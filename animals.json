However, it is only when she is alone like this that Puck does something truly remarkable: talk to her unborn baby.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/BBCEarthSub \n\n#DolphinsofSharkBay #BottlenosedDolphin #NaturalWorld \n\nWatch more: \nPlanet Earth http://bit.ly/PlanetEarthPlaylist \nBlue Planet http://bit.ly/BluePlanetPlaylist \nPlanet Earth II http://bit.ly/PlanetEarthIIPlaylist \nPlanet Dinosaur https://bit.ly/PlanetDinosaurPlaylist\n\nDolphins of Shark Bay \nIn a stunning new insight into the lives of wild dolphins, this film follows six remarkable months in the life of the 'Beachies': a family of six dolphins led by mother-to-be Puck who live in the shark-infested waters of Western Australia's Shark Bay. Using the latest miniature camera to eavesdrop on the Beachies' underwater lives, this moving story follows Puck and and the challenges she faces bringing up her newborn calf Samu. From learning to fish, to the ever-present threat of a shark attack, no day is ever the same. Including rarely seen footage of young dolphins and revelatory new behaviour, this is a heart-warming and emotional portrayal of one of the ocean's most revered creatures.\n\nWelcome to BBC EARTH!

Journalist Nisar Malik has decided to use his news skills to help promote and protect this highly endangered species. Each year generations of snow leopards have returned to the mountains to raise their young. Harsh seasons force this predator and its prey to the lower reaches of the valleys where Nisar follows their hunting, feeding and mating behaviours. For Nisar, this is a journey of discovery in which he finds beauty and peace in a place that he previously portrayed as dangerous and evil. For the viewer, the film offers a journey into a misrepresented and unknown part of the world.\n\nWelcome to BBC EARTH! The world is an amazing place full of stories, beauty and natural wonder.

                    "description": "On the trail of a doomed 19th century polar expedition, modern explorers met the same danger: devastating, unpredictable sea ice.\n\nFor centuries, the Northwest Passage, the long-sought sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through northern Canada, was a holy grail of Arctic exploration. Even now, sailing through it isn\u2019t guaranteed. Mark Synnott, a National Geographic Explorer, writer, and adventurer, attempted to sail his own boat through the Northwest Passage to retrace the doomed 1845 expedition of British explorer Sir John Franklin. None of the Franklin expedition\u2019s 129 men made it home, but what exactly happened remains a mystery.\n\nPhoto Caption\nMark Synnott poses for a portrait aboard his sailboat, Polar Sun. The Arctic, Synnott says, is \u201cpretty much the most magical place on Earth.\u201d But when sea ice cornered Synnott and Polar Sun into a Canadian bay while traversing the Northwest Passage, the scene felt less magical and more like a punch to the gut.\n\nCredit: Photograph by Renan Ozturk, National Geographic\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe \n\u27a1 Get more of Overheard at National Geographic here: https://bit.ly/OverheardPodcast \n\u27a1 Catch up on all episodes of Overheard at National Geographic: https://on.natgeo.com/3n9D3cF \n\nYou can also listen to the Overheard at National Geographic podcast on these platforms:\n\u27a1 Apple: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnApple \n\u27a1 Spotify: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnSpotify \n\u27a1 Stitcher: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnStitcher \n\u27a1 Google Podcasts: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnGoogle \n\u27a1 iHeart Radio: https://bit.ly/OverheardOniHeart \n\u27a1 Castbox: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnCastbox \n\n#NationalGeographic #Overheard #Podcast\n\nAbout Overheard at National Geographic:\nDocumenting democracy, Untwisting the world\u2019s largest tornado.

                        "description": "On the trail of a doomed 19th century polar expedition, modern explorers met the same danger: devastating, unpredictable sea ice.\n\nFor centuries, the Northwest Passage, the long-sought sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through northern Canada, was a holy grail of Arctic exploration. Even now, sailing through it isn\u2019t guaranteed. Mark Synnott, a National Geographic Explorer, writer, and adventurer, attempted to sail his own boat through the Northwest Passage to retrace the doomed 1845 expedition of British explorer Sir John Franklin. None of the Franklin expedition\u2019s 129 men made it home, but what exactly happened remains a mystery.\n\nPhoto Caption\nMark Synnott poses for a portrait aboard his sailboat, Polar Sun. The Arctic, Synnott says, is \u201cpretty much the most magical place on Earth.\u201d But when sea ice cornered Synnott and Polar Sun into a Canadian bay while traversing the Northwest Passage, the scene felt less magical and more like a punch to the gut.\n\nCredit: Photograph by Renan Ozturk, National Geographic\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe \n\u27a1 Get more of Overheard at National Geographic here: https://bit.ly/OverheardPodcast \n\u27a1 Catch up on all episodes of Overheard at National Geographic: https://on.natgeo.com/3n9D3cF \n\nYou can also listen to the Overheard at National Geographic podcast on these platforms:\n\u27a1 Apple: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnApple \n\u27a1 Spotify: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnSpotify \n\u27a1 Stitcher: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnStitcher \n\u27a1 Google Podcasts: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnGoogle \n\u27a1 iHeart Radio: https://bit.ly/OverheardOniHeart \n\u27a1 Castbox: https://bit.ly/OverheardOnCastbox \n\n#NationalGeographic #Overheard #Podcast\n\nAbout Overheard at National Geographic:\nDocumenting democracy, Untwisting the world\u2019s largest tornado.

While only in New Zealand do Orca families cooperatively - and ingeniously - hunt rays.\n\nThis series dives deep into the seas to discover stunning stories of New Zealand\u2019s native ocean animals. The series travels south to north, exploring six very special environments: it\u2019s great white shark versus little blue penguins in the southern oasis of Stewart Island; a fur-seal summer off New Zealand\u2019s wild west coast; a day out with the athletic Dusky Dolphins of Kaikoura; quality time with the big old snapper and crayfish of Goat Island; drama in the egg nurseries of the stunning Poor Knights Islands as parents try to protect their young , and predator versus prey as surfing Orcas travel the golden harbours of Northland, searching for their stingray victims. The range and behaviours of these species in such close proximity is fascinating; from the giant to the tiny and the acrobatic to the rock scrapers - there is plenty of action in these aquatic communities. Orcas and mud crabs, seals and crayfish play out their lives as close neighbours and their stories weave together to reveal entertaining animal dramas.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Ocean \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Although the creatures are safe from humans it doesn't mean their life is easy.\n\nThis series dives deep into the seas to discover stunning stories of New Zealand\u2019s native ocean animals. The series travels south to north, exploring six very special environments: it\u2019s great white shark versus little blue penguins in the southern oasis of Stewart Island; a fur-seal summer off New Zealand\u2019s wild west coast; a day out with the athletic Dusky Dolphins of Kaikoura; quality time with the big old snapper and crayfish of Goat Island; drama in the egg nurseries of the stunning Poor Knights Islands as parents try to protect their young , and predator versus prey as surfing Orcas travel the golden harbours of Northland, searching for their stingray victims. The range and behaviours of these species in such close proximity is fascinating; from the giant to the tiny and the acrobatic to the rock scrapers - there is plenty of action in these aquatic communities. Orcas and mud crabs, seals and crayfish play out their lives as close neighbours and their stories weave together to reveal entertaining animal dramas.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Ocean \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Both islands became cut off from the Asian mainland when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago. Large animals became marooned, isolated from their mainland cousins. Over time, they have adapted and evolved to their new home developing an array of unique traits on each island. Today, these are the Islands of Monsters.\n\nThe 17,000 islands that comprise the nation of Indonesia stretch more than 3,000 miles along the equator, bridging Asia and Australasia. Indonesia\u2019s natural habitats vary widely. On some islands, tropical forests climb from steamy lowlands to mountain slopes. On others, parched savannah thrives. Coral reefs line thousands of tranquil atolls, while relentless waves batter rocky cliffs on other shores. In Papua, the mountains reach so high that permanent ice caps top their peaks, surrounded by barren alpine tundra. These wildly ranging habitats are home to an incredible number and diversity of living creatures - this iconic and landmark series is a celebration of Indonesia\u2019s most spectacular locations and incredible wildlife.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Wildlife \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Then, a hundred thousand years ago, the craters turned into lakes and wildlife conquered the volcanic waters: from spectacled salamanders living in the lakes to the giant sperm whale swimming in the sea that surrounds the islands, skies dwelled by golden eagles hunting at the top of the volcano and Eleonora\u2019s falcons living on the cliffs.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #WildItaly \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Then, a hundred thousand years ago, the craters turned into lakes and wildlife conquered the volcanic waters: from spectacled salamanders living in the lakes to the giant sperm whale swimming in the sea that surrounds the islands, skies dwelled by golden eagles hunting at the top of the volcano and Eleonora\u2019s falcons living on the cliffs.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #WildItaly \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

But the lushness of nature reaches way beyond the shores: the Iroquoian and Algonquian people created a rich and fertile homeland of oak forests and grasslands where wildlife thrived. At the edge of Canada's vast boreal forest, we meet polar bear cubs and in Canada's west coast province of British Columbia, we explore the world's largest intact temperate rainforest.\n\nThis vast wild country, boasting the longest coastline in the world with shores on three oceans, has the greatest north-south latitude range of any nation in the world. Countless generations of humans have shaped Canada\u2019s nature for their own purposes and their own survival, ever since the kilometer-thick ice began to melt and the land beneath was exposed. Over time, next to humans an array of plants and animals invaded these regions as well \u2013 mammoths, moose, and musk ox were common sights in the vast plains of what now is Canada.\n\nIn this stunning documentary, a journey of exploration is at hand \u2013 to re-discover this remarkable and beautiful land with its fabulous landscapes and wildlife, seen through fresh eyes.

Filming inside a beaver\u2019s lodge, following the track of bears, swimming deep underwater alongside whales, or taking a macro-look at ice crystals: this production has it all.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #WildCanada\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free with the latest camera equipment used by well-known filmmakers working for famous production studios.

Its shadowy, damp virgin forests are filled with eerie sounds. The cry of the lemurs lures us into an enchanted world. It is no surprise that the native inhabitants developed an unusually spiritual relationship with nature, affected by animal legends, myths, taboos, and ancestor worship. \n\nThis documentary shows the stunning beauty and diversity of Madagascar\u2019s nature, the traditional and cultural relationship between the local people and their environment, and most of all it shows what the local people do to preserve their natural treasures. \nThe most wonderful spots of Madagascar are highly praised by eco-tourists, biologists, and scientists. But the preservation of these biological gems cannot be done without the Malagasy people themselves. \n\nIn different parts of the country, we encounter musicians, rangers, farmers, healers, boat builders, officers of the nature conservation authority, and many more, working hard to save what is still there of Madagascar's pristine beauty. Each in their special way strives to raise awareness for the work of conservationists and the importance of conservation to the fragile habitats of Madagascar and their own means of livelihood for future generations.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Madagascar \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free with the latest camera equipment used by well-known filmmakers working for famous production studios.

But the preservation of these biological gems cannot be done without the Malagasy people themselves. \n\nIn different parts of the country, we encounter musicians, rangers, farmers, healers, boat builders, officers of the nature conservation authority, and many more, working hard to save what is still there of Madagascar's pristine beauty. Each in their special way strives to raise awareness for the work of conservationists and the importance of conservation to the fragile habitats of Madagascar and their own means of livelihood for future generations.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Madagascar \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free with the latest camera equipment used by well-known filmmakers working for famous production studios.

Their behavior, and ability to develop, survive and adapt to a changing environment are evident.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #wildlife \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free with the latest camera equipment used by well-known filmmakers working for famous production studios.

This landmark series showcases the country\u2019s five largest habitats, from its ancient forests to the Tibetan grasslands, from the Yangtze\u2019s wetlands to China's megacities and surrounding oceans.\n\nThe series reveals never-before-seen behaviours, rare animals, and conservation in action, in extraordinary environments. In the forests, we join the territorial battles of rival Francois' leaf monkey clans, and discover new efforts to save the endangered Manchurian tigers and Amur leopards. We follow Tibetan foxes hunting pikas on the alpine grasslands, and the breeding season of the world's smallest crane, the Demoiselle. In the wetlands, we learn about the re-introduction of the Yangtze finless porpoise, and witness the mating rituals of the world's oldest marine creature - the Chinese horeshoe crab - with a history of over 300 million years. In the cities, we join north-eastern Chinese hedgehogs eking out a living in Beijing, and playful macaques feasting at Chinese New Year in the plateau city of Guiyang. In the oceans, we discover a recent proliferation of flame jellyfish, and follow the latest attempts to restore the northern edge of the coral triangle in the South China Sea, one of the world's richest underwater habitats.\n\nThis is the wild side of China, as you've never seen it before!\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #ChinaWild\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

This landmark series showcases the country\u2019s five largest habitats, from its ancient forests to the Tibetan grasslands, from the Yangtze\u2019s wetlands to China's megacities and surrounding oceans.\n\nThe series reveals never-before-seen behaviours, rare animals, and conservation in action, in extraordinary environments. In the forests, we join the territorial battles of rival Francois' leaf monkey clans, and discover new efforts to save the endangered Manchurian tigers and Amur leopards. We follow Tibetan foxes hunting pikas on the alpine grasslands, and the breeding season of the world's smallest crane, the Demoiselle. In the wetlands, we learn about the re-introduction of the Yangtze finless porpoise, and witness the mating rituals of the world's oldest marine creature - the Chinese horeshoe crab - with a history of over 300 million years. In the cities, we join north-eastern Chinese hedgehogs eking out a living in Beijing, and playful macaques feasting at Chinese New Year in the plateau city of Guiyang. In the oceans, we discover a recent proliferation of flame jellyfish, and follow the latest attempts to restore the northern edge of the coral triangle in the South China Sea, one of the world's richest underwater habitats.\n\nThis is the wild side of China, as you've never seen it before!\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #ChinaWild\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

A vast number of both animal and plant species unique to the region live in its various habitats. \nThe Mediterranean Basin is located in one of the planet\u2019s temperate zones. The subtropical climate makes it colder and wet here in winter, hot and dry in summer and mild and rainy in autumn and spring.  Occupied by human beings for more than 8000 years, the Mediterranean Basin has experienced dramatic changes to its forest and woodland areas, but nevertheless, they are still among the most diverse on the planet.

                    "description": "Glacier Bay National Park - Pristine Beauty in Alaska's South | Wildlife Documentary\n\nWatch 'Gates of the Arctic - America's Most Remote National Park' here: https://youtu.be/H_zzJZysj9o\n\nLocated at Alaska's most south-easterly point is a natural refuge: Glacier Bay National Park. An unspoiled wilderness of breathtaking beauty, where nature's entire repertoire is represented: snow-capped mountains, fjords, forests, beaches, bays and above all glaciers, in addition to a significant number of wild animals.\nGlacier Bay is a paradise for researchers. There is hardly anywhere else in the world where wild animals can be observed in their unspoiled habitats. Biologist Chris Gabriel has documented the migration of the humpback whale for more than 30 years and can distinguish the animals by their caudal fins. Park Ranger Tania Lewis however, has to negotiate the mountains in order to encounter her fosterlings: she has been monitoring the bear population in Glacier Bay since 2001. The photographer Kim Heacox is continually in search of the most impressive motifs of the park and catches them on camera.\nGlacier Bay is one of the last wild and unspoiled natural paradises on earth; a natural work of art which represents fascination and challenge for both man and animal.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #GlacierBay\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

An unspoiled wilderness of breathtaking beauty, where nature's entire repertoire is represented: snow-capped mountains, fjords, forests, beaches, bays and above all glaciers, in addition to a significant number of wild animals.\nGlacier Bay is a paradise for researchers. There is hardly anywhere else in the world where wild animals can be observed in their unspoiled habitats. Biologist Chris Gabriel has documented the migration of the humpback whale for more than 30 years and can distinguish the animals by their caudal fins. Park Ranger Tania Lewis however, has to negotiate the mountains in order to encounter her fosterlings: she has been monitoring the bear population in Glacier Bay since 2001. The photographer Kim Heacox is continually in search of the most impressive motifs of the park and catches them on camera.\nGlacier Bay is one of the last wild and unspoiled natural paradises on earth; a natural work of art which represents fascination and challenge for both man and animal.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #GlacierBay\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

This spectacular series will show you what happens beyond the lookouts.\n\nEverglades National Park is an American national park that protects the southern twenty percent of the original Everglades in Florida. The park is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, and the largest wilderness of any kind east of the Mississippi River. An average of one million people visit the park each year. Everglades is the third-largest national park in the contiguous United States after Death Valley and Yellowstone. UNESCO declared the Everglades & Dry Tortugas Biosphere Reserve in 1976, and listed the park as a World Heritage Site in 1979, while the Ramsar Convention included the park on its list of Wetlands of International Importance in 1987. Everglades is one of only three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.\n\nMost national parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park was the first created to protect a fragile ecosystem. The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing 0.25 miles per day out of Lake Okeechobee, southwest into Florida Bay. The park is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere. Thirty-six threatened or protected species inhabit the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee, along with 350 species of birds, 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles. The majority of South Florida's fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park.\n\nHumans have lived for thousands of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Everglades\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

People, animals and plants have had to adapt to the climate, find solutions to daily challenges and adjust to the different regions. But one fact links them: their time zone. We show you the natives of this dynamic zone who live from their natural environs. Discover the troubles, dreams and hopes of the people living along this geographical nexus.\n\nAs contrasting as the landscapes of the 15th meridian east, so different are its animal inhabitants. What are the living conditions like in the heat of the Namibian Damaraland, in Lusatia or on the coast of Norway? Which challenges do elephants, whales or kingfishers have to master together with their companions from north to south?\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #15thMeridianEast\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

With good territory comes plentiful food, access to shelter, attraction to mates and safety to raise offspring - all tremendous strategic advantages in the wild. For a territorial species, their territory is their kingdom. Those that want it will stop at nothing to get it, and those that have it will fight fiercely to defend it.\n\nIn the wild every creature has its own game plan. Attack and defence, communication and mating, hunting and claiming territory - for animals to succeed in the turmoil of nature they need strategy. With stunning archival footage and computer generated graphics, we observe the tactics animals use to survive and dominate in the wild.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #SurviveTheWild\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Animals adapt through a series of small, random mutations and usually do so in order to compete more effectively for food, water and space. Animals with certain adaptations are more likely to be stronger and therefore produce more young. Crocodiles are certainly of an ancient lineage, they are believed to be 200 million years old, whereas dinosaurs became extinct 64 million years ago. Crocodiles have an incredible ability to adapt and survive in the Race of Life. They have a very slow metabolism, and can go up to a year with no food. They also have a 4 chamber heart that helps them control their temperature, and lungs that allow them to hold their breath underwater for up to 2 hours. Sharks have gone through the process of adaptation and evolutionary experimentation as well. The modern descendants of ancient sharks have incorporated many of the successful traits of the past. They have changed over time, but the changes have not been too extreme, only nature perfecting an originally near perfect design. Whales are an amazing species that have evolved from land dwelling creatures millions of years ago to the marine mammals we know today. Over the course of their evolution whales have developed echolocation, thick layers of blubber, modified lungs, better hearing and larger arteries among other things to ensure their survival and prosperity. \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #RaceOfLife\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Animals adapt through a series of small, random mutations and usually do so in order to compete more effectively for food, water and space. Animals with certain adaptations are more likely to be stronger and therefore produce more young. Crocodiles are certainly of an ancient lineage, they are believed to be 200 million years old, whereas dinosaurs became extinct 64 million years ago. Crocodiles have an incredible ability to adapt and survive in the Race of Life. They have a very slow metabolism, and can go up to a year with no food. They also have a 4 chamber heart that helps them control their temperature, and lungs that allow them to hold their breath underwater for up to 2 hours. Sharks have gone through the process of adaptation and evolutionary experimentation as well. The modern descendants of ancient sharks have incorporated many of the successful traits of the past. They have changed over time, but the changes have not been too extreme, only nature perfecting an originally near perfect design. Whales are an amazing species that have evolved from land dwelling creatures millions of years ago to the marine mammals we know today. Over the course of their evolution whales have developed echolocation, thick layers of blubber, modified lungs, better hearing and larger arteries among other things to ensure their survival and prosperity. \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #RaceOfLife\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Many animals possess them, but seldom are they wielded with the lethal mastery we see in this episode. Crocodiles and wolves are apex predators, using their teeth with terrifying effect, ensuring they keep their place at the top of their respective food chains.  A simple flick of the baboon's lip reveals its menacing teeth, enough to strike fear into their enemies, and keep them at bay. Bears and tigers are infamous for the lethal wounds inflicted by their razor sharp claws. The owl's talons, though not as devastating in face to face combat, are unmatched when employed with stealth to take down their prey. Armored crabs fight and defend what's theirs by cutting and crushing foes in their pincers. In this episode of the Animal Armory we take a close look at these mighty instruments of destruction and the animals that wield them with such absolute precision.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #AnimalArmory\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Many animals possess them, but seldom are they wielded with the lethal mastery we see in this episode. Crocodiles and wolves are apex predators, using their teeth with terrifying effect, ensuring they keep their place at the top of their respective food chains.  A simple flick of the baboon's lip reveals its menacing teeth, enough to strike fear into their enemies, and keep them at bay. Bears and tigers are infamous for the lethal wounds inflicted by their razor sharp claws. The owl's talons, though not as devastating in face to face combat, are unmatched when employed with stealth to take down their prey. Armored crabs fight and defend what's theirs by cutting and crushing foes in their pincers. In this episode of the Animal Armory we take a close look at these mighty instruments of destruction and the animals that wield them with such absolute precision.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #AnimalArmory\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Its principal water source, the Omo River, has been dammed in neighboring Ethiopia. If the lake dries up, hundreds of thousands of Kenyans will lose their livelihoods as fishermen. Cattle grazing, previously the main activity of pastoral tribes in the region, is now impossible because of spreading deserts and climate change.

The Liuwa plain is a spectacular and remote African plain and the source of the mighty Zambezi River. Rich golden grasslands dominate this dramatic landscape; but every year violent storms hit the Liuwa and the Zambezi bursts it\u2019s banks, dramatically transforming this savannah into a vast lake shallow lake. Liuwa\u2019s wildlife is just as dynamic, some leave, others arrive and for those that stay, they have had to adapt to a changing landscape and compete fiercely for territory and food. Our story is told through the eyes of a permanent predator of the Liuwa plain, the last remaining lioness of Liuwa. She is the sole survivor of a senseless massacre that took the rest of her pride. She is a symbol of the Liuwa, a place that challenges all who live here and where adaptation is crucial to survival.

Contrasting characters collide and the fate of the troop is determined in a uniquely mandrill way.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Wildlife \n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

With their populations now in partial recovery, it is once again possible to find humpback whales around Rurutu in Polynesian waters. They congregate here between July and November to give birth to a new generation, and to mate. The newborns are prepared for a life of migration, covering thousands of kilometres every single year.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #AdventureOceanQuest\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

With their populations now in partial recovery, it is once again possible to find humpback whales around Rurutu in Polynesian waters. They congregate here between July and November to give birth to a new generation, and to mate. The newborns are prepared for a life of migration, covering thousands of kilometres every single year.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #AdventureOceanQuest\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Scientists at the University of British Columbia and the Vancouver Aquarium are working together to help save Canada\u2019s iconic and largest pinniped \u2013 the stellar sea lion\nTo help understand why their numbers are dropping, researchers work with the highly intelligent mammals at a unique floating laboratory. At The Open Water Research Station, free swimming seals and sea lions are observed in their natural habitat. In Alaska, wild stellar sea lions seem to be thriving, but prove to be an aggressive and difficult animal to study and photograph. At the research station, these tame, remarkable animals are providing fresh insights into the fragile ocean food chain of the North Pacific.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #BlueRealm\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

The series travels south to north, exploring six very special environments: it\u2019s great white shark versus little blue penguins in the southern oasis of Stewart Island; a fur-seal summer off New Zealand\u2019s wild west coast; a day out with the athletic Dusky Dolphins of Kaikoura; quality time with the big old snapper and crayfish of Goat Island; drama in the egg nurseries of the stunning Poor Knights Islands as parents try to protect their young , and predator versus prey as surfing Orcas travel the golden harbours of Northland, searching for their stingray victims. The range and behaviours of these species in such close proximity is fascinating; from the giant to the tiny and the acrobatic to the rock scrapers - there is plenty of action in these aquatic communities. Orcas and mud crabs, seals and crayfish play out their lives as close neighbours and their stories weave together to reveal entertaining animal dramas.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Ocean \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

The series travels south to north, exploring six very special environments: it\u2019s great white shark versus little blue penguins in the southern oasis of Stewart Island; a fur-seal summer off New Zealand\u2019s wild west coast; a day out with the athletic Dusky Dolphins of Kaikoura; quality time with the big old snapper and crayfish of Goat Island; drama in the egg nurseries of the stunning Poor Knights Islands as parents try to protect their young , and predator versus prey as surfing Orcas travel the golden harbours of Northland, searching for their stingray victims. The range and behaviours of these species in such close proximity is fascinating; from the giant to the tiny and the acrobatic to the rock scrapers - there is plenty of action in these aquatic communities. Orcas and mud crabs, seals and crayfish play out their lives as close neighbours and their stories weave together to reveal entertaining animal dramas.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Ocean \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

                    "description": "The Big Blue - Ocean Stories from Down Under | Episode 4: Kaikoura | Ocean Documentary\n\nWatch 'The Big Blue - Episode 5' here: https://youtu.be/dz3eGdW_s64\n\nIn this episode:\nNew Zealand's Kaikoura peninsula is home to the world's most acrobatic dolphin species, some of New Zealand's most robust young Fur Seals, and an unconventional group of Red-Billed Gull families.\n\nThis series dives deep into the seas to discover stunning stories of New Zealand\u2019s native ocean animals. The series travels south to north, exploring six very special environments: it\u2019s great white shark versus little blue penguins in the southern oasis of Stewart Island; a fur-seal summer off New Zealand\u2019s wild west coast; a day out with the athletic Dusky Dolphins of Kaikoura; quality time with the big old snapper and crayfish of Goat Island; drama in the egg nurseries of the stunning Poor Knights Islands as parents try to protect their young , and predator versus prey as surfing Orcas travel the golden harbours of Northland, searching for their stingray victims. The range and behaviours of these species in such close proximity is fascinating; from the giant to the tiny and the acrobatic to the rock scrapers - there is plenty of action in these aquatic communities. Orcas and mud crabs, seals and crayfish play out their lives as close neighbours and their stories weave together to reveal entertaining animal dramas.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Ocean \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.
