We're tasting INCREDIBLE Golden Chicken Biryani, different from Golden Pulao, but still an amazingly delicious Pakistani food!\n\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nKarachi is one of the oldest and most vibrant cities in the world and has one of the BEST street food scenes too! You need to travel to Pakistan to try the street food, especially the BIRYANI in Karachi!\n\nToday, we're bringing you Foodrangin' for LOTS of TRADITIONAL and AUTHENTIC Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING GOLDEN Chicken Biryani at Al Rehman Biryani! We're also having brain takatak (katakat) and some incredible Pakistani seafood in Karachi too!\n\nThis is RARE and DELICIOUS, and worth traveling to Pakistan for! You have to taste this food at least once in your lifetime!\n\nWhen you travel to Karachi, you will fall in  love with the street food as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Chicken biryani, where the masters prepare biryani for 100's of people every day! This is all prepared by local chefs in Karachi using PURE karachi style masalas!\n\nIt was found in downtown Karachi in an old area where there is street food everywhere! The basmati rice was the FLUFFIEST I've ever tasted and the potatoes were MASSIVE and soft! \n\nAfter this, we're going DEEPER into Karachi to Burns road, where there are 1000's of street foods and stalls to visit! This is before we bring you to a MASSIVE Pakistani SEAFOOD feast on the beachside in Karachi, right on the Arabian sea! \n\nNext up, we're going to a local Pakistan street food served right on the street side, the KARACHI HALEEM, found right on burns road! We got invited into the kitchen to see how the chefs prepare the haleem using their Pakistani recipes, it was absolutely amazing to watch it being prepared! There was so much chicken, masala, and pulses all being ground up to make the haleem! But this was just the beginning, after this we found the most INSANE Street Food in Pakistan!\n\nAfter tasting the haleem at Karachi Haleem, it was evening time and needed some street food to try before going to our Pakistani seafood feast. We found ourselves in a local alley in Karachi and found the CRAZIEST BRAIN FRY (bheja fry) with tomato! It was full of masala, brain, and also tons of oil! To be honest, it was quite heavy for me, but maybe once in a whilie it's OK to eat!  \n\nAfter this, we're meeting with our buddy Ali and he is taking us to his friends Shehroze and Alizeh's seaside home for a HUGE Pakistani SEAFOOD feast right on the ARABIAN SEA!  To me, this was some of the most unique food in Pakistan, especially being able to watch the cooking process of all the different seafoods! We had red snapper with a tamarind sauce, HUGE lobsters cooked in masala and ghee, crab claw LOLLIPOPS, calamari, shrimp curry, and more! It was SO TASTY!\n\nAfter this, the next day,  we made our way back into Karachi to visit the super famous Fish TAKATAK (katakat) at Mashalla Takatak! It uses sole fish and tons of masala, onions (piyaz), and coriander! It was amazing to watch the chopping and grilling of the fish in oil! Another famous seafood dish to try in Karachi! It was so UNIQUE!\n\nAnd for our final meal, we went to taste a WHOLE LAMB leg roast over the fire!!! It was amazing to taste, and the cooking process took over 2 hours! As it was being prepared, we watched the master chefs sprinkle local masala over it and also sprinkle it with lime after it was done!\n\nI hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series!

                    "description": "My new blog: https://travelsecurely.com\nStreet Food in Bangladesh is AMAZING! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!\n\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nMake sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:\n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25baMake sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\n\nBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. \n\nEverywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. \n\nThe Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!\n\nTo start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.\n\nAfter that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! \n\nAfter the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!\n\nAfter this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!\n\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nMake sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:\n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25baMake sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\n\nBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. \n\nEverywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. \n\nThe Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!\n\nTo start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.\n\nAfter that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! \n\nAfter the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!\n\nAfter this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!\n\nAfter the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!\n\nAfter this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!\n\nIf you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!\n\n\u25ba BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioil4life\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nWe're going for more street food around the world!\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\nBest Captioning services: https://www.thefoodranger.com/best-captioning-services/"

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF!  Today, we're bringing you for a HUGE Street Food tour of Chittagong, Bangladesh, tasting one of the BEST beef curry dishes in the WORLD, and, trying some INSANE street food on the streets of Chittagong, Bangladesh!\n\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nMake sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:\n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25baMake sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\n\nFirst up, we're taking you to try a famous street food in Bangladesh, the Jhal Muri with a rich dhal lentil curry. Here on the streets of Chittagong, it was super UNIQUE, because the street food vendor mixes the jhal muri with the dhal, which is full of hundreds of EGGS!!! The vendor also insisted that I eat a fresh green chili to go with it, it was SPICY!!!\n\nNext up, we're meeting with Mr. Monju, owner of Mezzan Haile Aaiun, who is bringing us into his back kitchen CURRY FACTORY for EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to watch how the world famous Chittagong street food and festival food of Mezbani beef is prepared (also sometimes spelled Mejbani beef). Here in the back kitchen, he has a large staff preparing the local masalas using local spices and by grinding up ginger and garlic on their own stone mortar and pestles. Watching the masala being made was an amazing experience!\n\nAs soon as we walked in, you could smell the rich beef aroma in the huge decks. The famous dish, the mezbani beef, is prepared using a dark brown masala that is full of roast cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, and local spices, and of course, the most famous ingredient for street food in Bangladesh, mustard oil. We watched the mezbani beef being prepared in this giant CURRY FACTORY and then made our way to Mr. Monju's restaurant and had a huge table full of delicious curry.\n\nWhen we arrived at Mezban Haile Aaiun, we ordered 4 dishes. The mejbani beef, the beef khala bhuna, the nola AKA beef nihari, and a chana dhal with huge chunks of beef. It was all incredibly delicious and was one of the best meals we had in Bangladesh, and made us both fall in love with Bangladeshi cuisine!\n\nThe next morning, we're getting up at 5am to bring you for the ULTIMATE Nihari AKA Nola in downtown Chittagong. This is a super famous street food all throughout Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Every country has their own way of cooking it, and here in Bangladesh, it was made with TONS of local desi ghee and fat from the beef bones and bone marrow. Slurping the beef bones is super satisfying because the fat is infused into the soup and you get a super strong flavour combined with all the local masala and naan!!!\n\nAnd to finish off our Bangladeshi street food tour in Chittagong, we're going to Nizam hotel for the ultimate Bangladeshi FEAST! One of the best things about food in Bangladesh is the mustardy kick to a lot of the curries, and here at Nizam hotel, we ordered a full table of chicken curry, beef curry, duck curry, turkey curry, and fish curry. And along with all of these curries, it was also served with tons of Bangladeshi bhortas, AKA mashed vegetable and dried fish dishes that are spicy and full of flavour!!! The best part about this amazing meal in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is the fact that you only pay for what you eat, and the rest is brought back to the kitchen!\n\nWe had an amazing time in Bangladesh and will definitely be back to make more of these food videos! I hope you enjoyed watching!\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba https://www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25ba3 Months FREE on ExpressVPN and 49% OFF! https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\nBest Captioning services: https://www.thefoodranger.com/best-captioning-services/",

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF!  Today, we're bringing you for a HUGE Street Food tour of Chittagong, Bangladesh, tasting one of the BEST beef curry dishes in the WORLD, and, trying some INSANE street food on the streets of Chittagong, Bangladesh!\n\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nMake sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:\n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25baMake sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\n\nFirst up, we're taking you to try a famous street food in Bangladesh, the Jhal Muri with a rich dhal lentil curry. Here on the streets of Chittagong, it was super UNIQUE, because the street food vendor mixes the jhal muri with the dhal, which is full of hundreds of EGGS!!! The vendor also insisted that I eat a fresh green chili to go with it, it was SPICY!!!\n\nNext up, we're meeting with Mr. Monju, owner of Mezzan Haile Aaiun, who is bringing us into his back kitchen CURRY FACTORY for EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to watch how the world famous Chittagong street food and festival food of Mezbani beef is prepared (also sometimes spelled Mejbani beef). Here in the back kitchen, he has a large staff preparing the local masalas using local spices and by grinding up ginger and garlic on their own stone mortar and pestles. Watching the masala being made was an amazing experience!\n\nAs soon as we walked in, you could smell the rich beef aroma in the huge decks. The famous dish, the mezbani beef, is prepared using a dark brown masala that is full of roast cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, and local spices, and of course, the most famous ingredient for street food in Bangladesh, mustard oil. We watched the mezbani beef being prepared in this giant CURRY FACTORY and then made our way to Mr. Monju's restaurant and had a huge table full of delicious curry.\n\nWhen we arrived at Mezban Haile Aaiun, we ordered 4 dishes. The mejbani beef, the beef khala bhuna, the nola AKA beef nihari, and a chana dhal with huge chunks of beef. It was all incredibly delicious and was one of the best meals we had in Bangladesh, and made us both fall in love with Bangladeshi cuisine!\n\nThe next morning, we're getting up at 5am to bring you for the ULTIMATE Nihari AKA Nola in downtown Chittagong. This is a super famous street food all throughout Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Every country has their own way of cooking it, and here in Bangladesh, it was made with TONS of local desi ghee and fat from the beef bones and bone marrow. Slurping the beef bones is super satisfying because the fat is infused into the soup and you get a super strong flavour combined with all the local masala and naan!!!\n\nAnd to finish off our Bangladeshi street food tour in Chittagong, we're going to Nizam hotel for the ultimate Bangladeshi FEAST! One of the best things about food in Bangladesh is the mustardy kick to a lot of the curries, and here at Nizam hotel, we ordered a full table of chicken curry, beef curry, duck curry, turkey curry, and fish curry. And along with all of these curries, it was also served with tons of Bangladeshi bhortas, AKA mashed vegetable and dried fish dishes that are spicy and full of flavour!!! The best part about this amazing meal in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is the fact that you only pay for what you eat, and the rest is brought back to the kitchen!\n\nWe had an amazing time in Bangladesh and will definitely be back to make more of these food videos! I hope you enjoyed watching!\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba https://www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25ba3 Months FREE on ExpressVPN and 49% OFF! https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger\n\u25baThe BEST VPNs For China: https://thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\nBest Captioning services: https://www.thefoodranger.com/best-captioning-services/"

It was sweet and super tasty!\n\nAnd to finish our MUD CRAB TOUR, we're going for a famous Sri Lankan street food, the isso wade and Kakkulo Wade, AKA crab and shrimp cakes fried with a lentil and gram flour batter.

You're going to love this GIANT Crab Adventure! We have 4 different varieties of crab in Sri Lanka! We're bringing YOU with us as we travel in Sri Lanka to taste the BEST food and street food in Sri Lanka! There is so much variety to Sri Lankan cuisine and Sri Lankan food, and we are taking you with us to taste it in this Sri Lankan food series!\n\nFirst up, we're traveling to the Seafood market and Mud Crab lagoon outside of Colombo. Here, in Negombo, there's a huge fish market where you can purchase fresh seafood and delicious mud crabs. The coolest part is how you can visit the mud crab \"nest\" and purchase one and then bring it to a local Sri Lankan restaurant to cook for you. We found 2 PLUMP mud crabs and brought them to the old rest house in Negombo to cook up Negombo style. It was full of Sri Lankan spices like chili and garlic and pandan leaves and their secret peppery spice mix. We also had other famous Sri Lankan foods like string hoppers, dhal, coconut sambol AKA pol sambola and Sri Lankan cuttlefish. It was all so delicious! \n\nAfter that, we traveled to Upalis restaurant in downtown colombo for a delicious chili crab. This was another big mud crab that was cooked in a spicy Jaffna style spice mix and a sweet tomato sauce. It was very delicious as well! It was also served with a delicious Sri Lankan mutton curry and a rice and curry banana leaf plate! Sri Lankan food is AMAZING!!\n\nAfter this, we're going to another MUD CRAB restaurant, the Station LK and eating a different Sri Lankan style mud crab, cooked with curry powder and curry leaves and more Jaffna style spices!

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!\n\n\u25baCheck out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribe\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nThis is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.\n\nIf you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.\n\nFirst, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:\n\nEntire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant\nAddress: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates\n\nIf you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nIn the next video, we're going for even more street food around the world!\n\nThanks so much for watching all of my Egyptian street food tour videos!

We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!\n\n\u25baCheck out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribe\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nThis is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.\n\nIf you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.\n\nFirst, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:\n\nEntire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant\nAddress: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates\n\nIf you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nIn the next video, we're going for even more street food around the world!\n\nThanks so much for watching all of my Egyptian street food tour videos!

This is incredibly delicious and hearty.\n\nOur final street food location is actually a huge Egyptian restaurant that has outdoor grills and some of the BEST BBQ meat in the country. We are eating of course at the one and only The Prince restaurant in Cairo. \n\nBut first, we are making our way to the one and only famous Egyptian pyramids. No trip to Cairo would be complete without visiting the Pyramids.\n\nAnd when we made our way to the prince, we had the BEST BBQ in Egypt!\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nIn the next video, we're going for even more street food around the world!\n\nThanks so much for watching all of my Egyptian street food tour videos!

Today, we're GOING DEEP for a FULL-on Street Food BREAKFAST Adventure of Marrakech, Morocco! Moroccan Street Food is some of the BEST in the WORLD, and today, we're going bright and early for a TASTY breakfast tour of Downtown Marrakech, trying a ton of delicious Moroccan street food for breakfast!\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nIn Marrakech, there is a ton of amazing street food on every street corner. We travelled to Morocco solely to eat, and chose Marrakech because we heard the food is amazing and that the people are friendly. When we arrived, we started to explore the souq alleyways near Jama El Fna square in downtown Marrakech. What you can find in the souqs will blow you away. There is so many different Moroccan street foods to try. We quickly discovered that Morocco has some of the best street food in the world. So tasty!\n\nFirst up, we found a friendly Bissara soup vendor who let us film this street food vlog and was happy to serve us. The Bissara soup is a fava bean aka broadbean soup served with bread for breakfast. It was scooped out of a big pot and served by bowl to all the hungry locals. This man was definitely a character, and super friendly too. He gave all the local Moroccans a free bowl if they couldn't afford it. \n\nNext, we went for another local street food in Morocco, the Hassowa. It was a super strong, almost spicy soup made from oregano and semolina. The man who served this street food in Marrakech had served this for 16 years in the streets of the old Medina in Marrakech. \n\nAfter this, we went for more Moroccan breakfast and ordered a Msemen moroccan flatbread. It was served with a ton of butter and honey and was super oily yet crispy at the same time. The lady who cooked it was also very friendly and was making a ton of the msemen for the hungry locals!\n\nFor our next breakfast meal, we enjoyed a truly classic Moroccan breakfast street food, the Khlea. The Khlea is a moroccan omelette made with 2 or 3 eggs and a few slices of Khlea preserved beef with smen moroccan preserved butter. It was super heavy and a little salty from the butter and beef.\n\nAnd for our final meal, while not quite breakfast, was a Moroccan tajine made with beef and carrots and potato and zuchinni, found right on the street!\n\nThe addresses for the street food locations found in this street food vlog are below:\n\n1) Bissara soup vendor: Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a ton of guys around the wall in the morning selling it.\n\n2) Hassowa soup vendor: Near the Jama El Fna square of old Marrakech. This one was just a lucky find, you gotta go deep into the alleyways to find stuff like this.\n\n3) Msemen Moroccan flatbread. You can find this one again in the back alleyways. Right behind the olive guys at the back of the Jama El Fna square in the morning for breakfast.\n\n4) Khlea egg omelette with preserved beef and smen butter. We found this one at a local cafe called Zeitoun Cafe AKA the olive cafe in the Medina of Marrakech.. I must admit it was a little tourist and maybe less DEEP than other places, but the omelette was nice and tasty.\n\n5) Delicious Moroccan Tajine DEEP in the streets. This one was also near the Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a street full of restaurants selling everything from these tajines to grilled BBQ fish and more. It was amazing!\n\nThe Food Ranger YouTube: \n\u25ba www.youtube.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger Instagram:\n\u25ba www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nThe Food Ranger FB:\n\u25ba www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES:\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nThanks so much for watching all of my Moroccan street food tour videos!\n \u25ba My Food Blog: https://www.thefoodranger.com/\nBest Captioning services: https://www.thefoodranger.com/best-captioning-services/",

Today, we're GOING DEEP for a FULL-on Street Food BREAKFAST Adventure of Marrakech, Morocco! Moroccan Street Food is some of the BEST in the WORLD, and today, we're going bright and early for a TASTY breakfast tour of Downtown Marrakech, trying a ton of delicious Moroccan street food for breakfast!\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nIn Marrakech, there is a ton of amazing street food on every street corner. We travelled to Morocco solely to eat, and chose Marrakech because we heard the food is amazing and that the people are friendly. When we arrived, we started to explore the souq alleyways near Jama El Fna square in downtown Marrakech. What you can find in the souqs will blow you away. There is so many different Moroccan street foods to try. We quickly discovered that Morocco has some of the best street food in the world. So tasty!\n\nFirst up, we found a friendly Bissara soup vendor who let us film this street food vlog and was happy to serve us. The Bissara soup is a fava bean aka broadbean soup served with bread for breakfast. It was scooped out of a big pot and served by bowl to all the hungry locals. This man was definitely a character, and super friendly too. He gave all the local Moroccans a free bowl if they couldn't afford it. \n\nNext, we went for another local street food in Morocco, the Hassowa. It was a super strong, almost spicy soup made from oregano and semolina. The man who served this street food in Marrakech had served this for 16 years in the streets of the old Medina in Marrakech. \n\nAfter this, we went for more Moroccan breakfast and ordered a Msemen moroccan flatbread. It was served with a ton of butter and honey and was super oily yet crispy at the same time. The lady who cooked it was also very friendly and was making a ton of the msemen for the hungry locals!\n\nFor our next breakfast meal, we enjoyed a truly classic Moroccan breakfast street food, the Khlea. The Khlea is a moroccan omelette made with 2 or 3 eggs and a few slices of Khlea preserved beef with smen moroccan preserved butter. It was super heavy and a little salty from the butter and beef.\n\nAnd for our final meal, while not quite breakfast, was a Moroccan tajine made with beef and carrots and potato and zuchinni, found right on the street!\n\nThe addresses for the street food locations found in this street food vlog are below:\n\n1) Bissara soup vendor: Bab doukkala area of Marrakech. You can find a ton of guys around the wall in the morning selling it.\n\n2) Hassowa soup vendor: Near the Jama El Fna square of old Marrakech.

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF!  Today, we're going for a FULL-ON street food tour to try the best street food in Tokyo, Japan!\n\nToday, I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) bringing you in DEEP to some amazing street foods in Tokyo, Japan, starting out in the morning at the Tsukiji fish market to try some delicious street food and INSANE Sashimi! You can find everything in this market, from fresh Japanese seafood like sliced raw tuna, scallops, king crab, and more. This is the best place to stop if you want to try delicious Tokyo Street Food!\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://bit.ly/FoodRangerMusic\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nWe're starting out with our first Japanese street food by trying a nice Uni Ikura Don also known as sea urchin and salmon roe bowl. This is the perfect street food to try in Japan in the morning for breakfast! You can also eat amazing fresh sashimi in this sushi restaurant, but I preferred the bowl of salmon roe and sea urchin.\n\nAfter this, we found the most INSANE Sashimi stall, serving up fresh tuna sashimi by the cube, sliced right in front of you! It doesn't get any better than this! It is served to you with a little soy and wasabi, absolutely perfect!\n\nAfter the amazing tuna sashimi, we went deeper into the Tsukiji market to find some other Japanese street food, and found a stall selling more raw Japanese seafood, and decided to try the raw scallops. They were super tasty!\n\nAfter this we found a stall selling a dish known as Kuromon don, a rich beef offal stew over top of rice and topped with green onions. It was very delicious and super fun to enjoy right on the street! You just pull up a chair and sit down on the counter and watch them scoop up this delicious Japanese street food right before your eyes!\n\nAfter this, we went for a famous bowl of ramen noodles in Japan, at Ichiran ramen. It is a Tonkatsu style broth, so quite creamy and rich, and the best part is how you can customize it exactly how you want it, with different levels of spiciness and richness, all from a machine!\n\nAfter this amazing ramen, we went for a once in a lifetime Sushi experience at Nishi-azabu Kamikura. It wasn't cheap, but it was an amazing experience that you will always remember. The master chef cuts each piece of raw fish for you and creates Sushi for you individually and serves it to you by hand. It's unforgettable and you can taste new flavours and textures with each piece.\n\nHere are the addresses for the restaurants we ate at in this Japanese street food video:\n\n1) Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe Bowl:\n Restaurant name:  Tsukiji Itadori Uogashi Senryo\nAddress:  4-10-14 Tsukiji, Chuo 104-0045, Tokyo \n\n2) Amazing Sashimi Stall at the Tsukiji fish market:\nStall name:  Tsukiji Itadori Uogashi Senryo\n\n3) Delicious Raw Scallops:\nFound inside the Tsujiji Fish market in Tokyo, Japan\n\n4) Delicious Beef Offal Stew:\nRestaurant name:  Kitsuneya\nAddress: 4-9-12 Chuo-ku, Tokyo \n\n5) Tasty bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen:\nRestaurant name:  Ichiran Shibuya\nAddress: 1 Chome-22-7 Jinnan, Shibuya, Tokyo\n\n6) Once in a lifetime Sushi and Sashimi experience:\nRestaurant name:  Nishi-azabu Kamikura\nAddress: 4-2-9 Nishi Azabu | Seasons Nishiazabu, Minato 106-0031, Tokyo\n\nEven after eating all of these amazing street foods in Tokyo, there is so many more things to eat! You will definitely have to travel here to try them all!\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoodRanger\nInsta: https://instagram.com/thefoodranger\n\nLove the music I use?

                        "description": "My new blog: https://travelsecurely.com\nJapanese Street Food in Tokyo, Japan, is some of the BEST Street Food in the world. Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF!  Today, we're going for a FULL-ON street food tour to try the best street food in Tokyo, Japan!\n\nToday, I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) bringing you in DEEP to some amazing street foods in Tokyo, Japan, starting out in the morning at the Tsukiji fish market to try some delicious street food and INSANE Sashimi! You can find everything in this market, from fresh Japanese seafood like sliced raw tuna, scallops, king crab, and more. This is the best place to stop if you want to try delicious Tokyo Street Food!\n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://bit.ly/FoodRangerMusic\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nWe're starting out with our first Japanese street food by trying a nice Uni Ikura Don also known as sea urchin and salmon roe bowl. This is the perfect street food to try in Japan in the morning for breakfast! You can also eat amazing fresh sashimi in this sushi restaurant, but I preferred the bowl of salmon roe and sea urchin.\n\nAfter this, we found the most INSANE Sashimi stall, serving up fresh tuna sashimi by the cube, sliced right in front of you! It doesn't get any better than this! It is served to you with a little soy and wasabi, absolutely perfect!\n\nAfter the amazing tuna sashimi, we went deeper into the Tsukiji market to find some other Japanese street food, and found a stall selling more raw Japanese seafood, and decided to try the raw scallops. They were super tasty!\n\nAfter this we found a stall selling a dish known as Kuromon don, a rich beef offal stew over top of rice and topped with green onions. It was very delicious and super fun to enjoy right on the street! You just pull up a chair and sit down on the counter and watch them scoop up this delicious Japanese street food right before your eyes!\n\nAfter this, we went for a famous bowl of ramen noodles in Japan, at Ichiran ramen. It is a Tonkatsu style broth, so quite creamy and rich, and the best part is how you can customize it exactly how you want it, with different levels of spiciness and richness, all from a machine!\n\nAfter this amazing ramen, we went for a once in a lifetime Sushi experience at Nishi-azabu Kamikura. It wasn't cheap, but it was an amazing experience that you will always remember. The master chef cuts each piece of raw fish for you and creates Sushi for you individually and serves it to you by hand. It's unforgettable and you can taste new flavours and textures with each piece.\n\nHere are the addresses for the restaurants we ate at in this Japanese street food video:\n\n1) Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe Bowl:\n Restaurant name:  Tsukiji Itadori Uogashi Senryo\nAddress:  4-10-14 Tsukiji, Chuo 104-0045, Tokyo \n\n2) Amazing Sashimi Stall at the Tsukiji fish market:\nStall name:  Tsukiji Itadori Uogashi Senryo\n\n3) Delicious Raw Scallops:\nFound inside the Tsujiji Fish market in Tokyo, Japan\n\n4) Delicious Beef Offal Stew:\nRestaurant name:  Kitsuneya\nAddress: 4-9-12 Chuo-ku, Tokyo \n\n5) Tasty bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen:\nRestaurant name:  Ichiran Shibuya\nAddress: 1 Chome-22-7 Jinnan, Shibuya, Tokyo\n\n6) Once in a lifetime Sushi and Sashimi experience:\nRestaurant name:  Nishi-azabu Kamikura\nAddress: 4-2-9 Nishi Azabu | Seasons Nishiazabu, Minato 106-0031, Tokyo\n\nEven after eating all of these amazing street foods in Tokyo, there is so many more things to eat!

Indian Street Food Tour of your DREAMS! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! The BEST Street Food in India is Kolkata Street Food in India! In this STREET FOOD tour VLOG, we're taking YOU on a street food tour of some of the BEST street foods in Kolkata, India! Here, Bengali Street Food and amazing curry is everywhere! \n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nYou won't believe the amazing street food here in Kolkata. Indian street food and Indian cuisine is so diverse, and all over the streets of India, you can find so many varieties of Indian spices and flavours. In this video, Myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) and Ting are going DEEP for street food in Kolkata, trying some AMAZING Bengali Street Foods in Kolkata, and some AMAZING curry and biryani rice.\n\nYou can eat amazing spicy and flavourful mutton biryani rice, some super sweet and saffron packed chai tea, a ton of delicious street foods like the Kathi roll and a ton of specialties on deckers lane.\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nTo start our street food tour, we woke up early in the morning to have an Indian Breakfast, an Indian street food breakfast! We went to a local tea shop to have some chai tea and a super delicious potato curry, known as a sabzi, and a flavourful kachori to dip it in! Watching the Indian restaurants and street food stalls like this in action, preparing and cooking the Indian recipes that have been done like this for generations is simply amazing!\n\nAfter tasting that saffron and sugar packed chai, along with the amazing potato vegetarian curry, we kept exploring the back streets of Kolkata to try and eat the best street foods of Kolkata. \n\nHere, you can travel to India just for the food, and that's exactly what we did! \n\nAfter the tea, we went to find some classic Bengali street foods on the street corners, and found a super flavourful bhel puri AKA puffed rice with a spicy mango chutney! This was actually very sour and spicy and so delicious!\n\nWe then continued traveling in Kolkata's busy and spice scented streets for more delicious foods, and found the amazing hot kathi roll. \nThis is marinated chicken in a ton of spice and yoghurt, wrapped up in a freshly fried paratha that's covered in a couple eggs, almost like an omelette, a HUGE omelette over top of the paratha! Then the paratha is wrapped up right on the street and you can taste the amazing flavors!\n\nAfter that, we enjoyed a walk through the busy streets of Kolkata and made our way to deckers lane, the most iconic heritage street food mecca of Kolkata, to try an amazing and spice packed chicken stew. It was quite peppery and delicious! \n\nAfter a quick walk and one street orange juice later, we arrived at Arsalan biryani rice and curry Indian restaurant to taste the famous mutton biryani and also try the amazing selection of spicy Indian curries. These bengali specialties were simply delicious, a MUST try thing here in Kolkata.\n\nHere are the addresses for the street food locations we tried in Kolkata:\n\n1) Street Chai Tea with Aloo Vegetarian Curry at ATS Arun Tea Stall\n2) Bhel Puri puffed spicy rice snack - New Market area street stall\n3) Kolkata's Famous Kathi Roll at Kusum's Roll on Park Street, Kolkata\n4) Famous Chicken soup on Deckers lane\n5) Amazingly Fresh Orange juice right on the street right near KC Das Sweet Shop \n6) HUGE Bengali Indian restaurant dinner - Featuring Bengali Biryani spiced rice and a ton of delicious curry dishes - at ARSALAN park Circus\n\nThis is part 1 of 5 in our Kolkata Street Food tour series, and part 1 of many in our Indian street food tour series, we are going to keep coming back to India, probably twice per year, the street food and the local Indian recipes are just too good!\n\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .

Indian Street Food Tour of your DREAMS! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! The BEST Street Food in India is Kolkata Street Food in India! In this STREET FOOD tour VLOG, we're taking YOU on a street food tour of some of the BEST street foods in Kolkata, India! Here, Bengali Street Food and amazing curry is everywhere! \n\n\u25ba The BEST VPNs for China:\nhttps://www.thefoodranger.com/best-vpn-for-china/\n\nYou won't believe the amazing street food here in Kolkata. Indian street food and Indian cuisine is so diverse, and all over the streets of India, you can find so many varieties of Indian spices and flavours. In this video, Myself (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) and Ting are going DEEP for street food in Kolkata, trying some AMAZING Bengali Street Foods in Kolkata, and some AMAZING curry and biryani rice.\n\nYou can eat amazing spicy and flavourful mutton biryani rice, some super sweet and saffron packed chai tea, a ton of delicious street foods like the Kathi roll and a ton of specialties on deckers lane.\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nTo start our street food tour, we woke up early in the morning to have an Indian Breakfast, an Indian street food breakfast! We went to a local tea shop to have some chai tea and a super delicious potato curry, known as a sabzi, and a flavourful kachori to dip it in! Watching the Indian restaurants and street food stalls like this in action, preparing and cooking the Indian recipes that have been done like this for generations is simply amazing!\n\nAfter tasting that saffron and sugar packed chai, along with the amazing potato vegetarian curry, we kept exploring the back streets of Kolkata to try and eat the best street foods of Kolkata. \n\nHere, you can travel to India just for the food, and that's exactly what we did! \n\nAfter the tea, we went to find some classic Bengali street foods on the street corners, and found a super flavourful bhel puri AKA puffed rice with a spicy mango chutney! This was actually very sour and spicy and so delicious!\n\nWe then continued traveling in Kolkata's busy and spice scented streets for more delicious foods, and found the amazing hot kathi roll. \nThis is marinated chicken in a ton of spice and yoghurt, wrapped up in a freshly fried paratha that's covered in a couple eggs, almost like an omelette, a HUGE omelette over top of the paratha! Then the paratha is wrapped up right on the street and you can taste the amazing flavors!\n\nAfter that, we enjoyed a walk through the busy streets of Kolkata and made our way to deckers lane, the most iconic heritage street food mecca of Kolkata, to try an amazing and spice packed chicken stew. It was quite peppery and delicious! \n\nAfter a quick walk and one street orange juice later, we arrived at Arsalan biryani rice and curry Indian restaurant to taste the famous mutton biryani and also try the amazing selection of spicy Indian curries. These bengali specialties were simply delicious, a MUST try thing here in Kolkata.\n\nHere are the addresses for the street food locations we tried in Kolkata:\n\n1) Street Chai Tea with Aloo Vegetarian Curry at ATS Arun Tea Stall\n2) Bhel Puri puffed spicy rice snack - New Market area street stall\n3) Kolkata's Famous Kathi Roll at Kusum's Roll on Park Street, Kolkata\n4) Famous Chicken soup on Deckers lane\n5) Amazingly Fresh Orange juice right on the street right near KC Das Sweet Shop \n6) HUGE Bengali Indian restaurant dinner - Featuring Bengali Biryani spiced rice and a ton of delicious curry dishes - at ARSALAN park Circus\n\nThis is part 1 of 5 in our Kolkata Street Food tour series, and part 1 of many in our Indian street food tour series, we are going to keep coming back to India, probably twice per year, the street food and the local Indian recipes are just too good!\n\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .

If you're thinking about traveling to China for the street food, make sure to come visit Beijing. You can enjoy unique Chinese street foods hidden in Beijing's Hutong Alleyways and try some classic Chinese cuisine favorites like Peking duck AKA Beijing duck, Jian bing ( \u714e\u997c) AKA Chinese crepes, and a ton of other hidden specialties. \n In the past 3 years, I've shot and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world!\n \nChinese cuisine is so fantastic, it would really take a lifetime to eat all of it. I consider myself super lucky and fortunate to be able to live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, eating Sichuan food and sampling food across the whole country whenever I get the chance. I've decided to stay living in China for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!\n\nHere are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Chinese street food I had in this Beijing travel video. Most locations were deep in Beijing's Hutong alleyways!\n\n1) Famous beijing breakfast Jianbing - AKA Chinese Crepe \n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5927\u5174\u80e1\u540c\u5185\u3002\n2) Delicious Sesame butter porridge made from millet AKA Miancha:\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5357\u5927\u5174\u80e1\u540c7\u53f7\n3) Very stinky Douzhi fermented green bean porridge (even stinkier than stinky tofu!)\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5929\u575b\u5317\u95e8\u5bf9\u9762\u8001\u78c1\u5668\u53e3\u8c46\u6c41\u5e97\n4) Organ soup and specialty Beijing zhajiang noodles AKA Zhajiangmian!\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u4e1c\u56db\u5317\u5927\u8857141\u53f7\u8001\u5317\u4eac\u767e\u5e74\u5364\u716e\u5e97\n5) Beijing Duck / Peking duck!\n.\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5317\u65b0\u6865\u5934\u676155\u53f7\u82b1\u5bb6\u6021\u56ed\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .\n\nI enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

If you're thinking about traveling to China for the street food, make sure to come visit Beijing. You can enjoy unique Chinese street foods hidden in Beijing's Hutong Alleyways and try some classic Chinese cuisine favorites like Peking duck AKA Beijing duck, Jian bing ( \u714e\u997c) AKA Chinese crepes, and a ton of other hidden specialties. \n In the past 3 years, I've shot and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world!\n \nChinese cuisine is so fantastic, it would really take a lifetime to eat all of it. I consider myself super lucky and fortunate to be able to live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, eating Sichuan food and sampling food across the whole country whenever I get the chance. I've decided to stay living in China for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!\n\nHere are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Chinese street food I had in this Beijing travel video. Most locations were deep in Beijing's Hutong alleyways!\n\n1) Famous beijing breakfast Jianbing - AKA Chinese Crepe \n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5927\u5174\u80e1\u540c\u5185\u3002\n2) Delicious Sesame butter porridge made from millet AKA Miancha:\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5357\u5927\u5174\u80e1\u540c7\u53f7\n3) Very stinky Douzhi fermented green bean porridge (even stinkier than stinky tofu!)\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5929\u575b\u5317\u95e8\u5bf9\u9762\u8001\u78c1\u5668\u53e3\u8c46\u6c41\u5e97\n4) Organ soup and specialty Beijing zhajiang noodles AKA Zhajiangmian!\n\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u4e1c\u56db\u5317\u5927\u8857141\u53f7\u8001\u5317\u4eac\u767e\u5e74\u5364\u716e\u5e97\n5) Beijing Duck / Peking duck!\n.\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u4e1c\u57ce\u533a\u5317\u65b0\u6865\u5934\u676155\u53f7\u82b1\u5bb6\u6021\u56ed\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious .\n\nI enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

We began our journey in Chengdu, and took a 24 hour slow train to Xining. We came to try a ton of street food and specialty halal street snacks. Xining is located in the northwest of China, in Qinghai province, which isclose to the far west Xinjiang province, our ultimate destination of Kashgar. Xining is home to the Hui people along with a sizable population of Tibetans, and the food was fantastic! There were a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!\n\nStreet food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So we took the train to Xining, China and on our first day, only got to try a little bit of Muslim Hui Halal Street food. But definitely some of the Best Street Food in China that I've tried! The Chinese food and halal food is so good in Xining!

We began our journey in Chengdu, and took a 24 hour slow train to Xining. We came to try a ton of street food and specialty halal street snacks. Xining is located in the northwest of China, in Qinghai province, which isclose to the far west Xinjiang province, our ultimate destination of Kashgar. Xining is home to the Hui people along with a sizable population of Tibetans, and the food was fantastic! There were a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!\n\nStreet food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So we took the train to Xining, China and on our first day, only got to try a little bit of Muslim Hui Halal Street food. But definitely some of the Best Street Food in China that I've tried! The Chinese food and halal food is so good in Xining! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Xining has been some of the best! \n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\n\nWhen you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest, especially as you make your way further west. We made our way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Xining specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people experience or even travel to, and we came here to have an authentic travel and food tour. We found a ton of food similar to  countries further west, with insane amounts of BBQ lamb and beef leaving me and Ting Ting absolutely speechless. \n\nHere are the addresses/locations for the places that I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food in Xining, China.

First, I visited this local market near the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and found Chinese street food and the atmosphere to be mind blowing and exciting!

Fresh handmade noodles, fresh Sichuan cold \"liangbancai\", and a huge meat market deli area with hanging pork and beef to choose from. All of the locals were friendly and talkative, although a bit surprised to see a foreigner walking through the area!\n\nIf you're visiting China as a tourist, you'll definitely want to take a walk through a busy morning market like this.

This market was mind blowing!\n\nRather than trying hot pot in Chengdu or hot pot in Chongqing, you could try some way cooler food in Chengdu at  local market like this. This should be a top priority in my opinion!\n\nChinese cuisine is so diverse, and I consider myself lucky to be able to live in Sichuan, eating Sichuan food everyday, tasting all the top Chinese foods to try whenever I want.

I ordered two bowls of steaming noodles and experienced one super delicious bowl, and one unfortunate bowl that wasn't very good at all! \n\nPlease like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin\n\nSichuan food is so delicious, and I've been living here in Chengdu for almost 2 years now, eating up as many delicious meals as I can. I love Sichuan noodles more than northern noodles mainly for the fact that they are spicier and more flavorful, with more Sichuan peppercorn, more chilies, and I always order \"ganban\" which is dry mix, leaving a nice portion of chili oil  and garlic and chiles on the bottom of the bowl that you get to mix into the noodles so nicely, infusing that awesome flavour throughout the noodles. That's the meaning of life!!\n\nThis noodle restaurant serves mainly noodles but they also had BBQ, also known as Shaokao, which ia a popular Chinese street food I have tried before but had to decline to trying it again at this location, since last time I got sick.  The shaokao has a lot of skewers of different meats and vegetables, even whole fish, that they throw over a grill and serve to you steaming hot. The Chinese barbecue is better at more cleaner places. Chengdu food is where life is at though, I recommend coming here to try out how delicious it is!\n\nAddress:\n\u4e00\u73af\u8def\u897f\u4e09\u6bb51\u53f7\uff08\u8fd1\u6e29\u54e5\u534e\u5e7f\u573a\uff09\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

                    "description": "Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! \nFOOD RANGER MERCH NOW AVAILABLE! http://bit.ly/FOODRANGER\nFollow me on Insta: http://bit.ly/2c5ojch\nAnd subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\nIt's hard to find quality, mind-blowing Durian in China. It's because it's all exported from Malaysia and Thailand and you're never sure if it's prime quality or just medium grade. The store featured in this video usually has kept me satisfied with \"Golden Pillow\" variety, but today, something else happened.\n\nPlease like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin\n\nI come to this store every week, splurge on a fat $20 durian,  then put it in my bike basket and  go to a local tea drinking spot on the sidewalk and chow down with a cup of tea. I usually get so full that I can't eat dinner. The durian burps that come afterwards and even onto the next morning are a reminder of how much durian I ate.\n\nHowever, this time, something went wrong. I bought a nice plump durian from my favourite fruit vendor who always gifts me  things because I'm a repeat customer who buys the most expensive fruit in the store. I was ready to chow into that soft, smooth, creamy and heavenly durian, but discovered something that really saddened me, the durian wasn't that soft! The first few bites are always a little more satisfying, it's like taking that first breath of air after holding your breath for a while, it's good, but you soon become more picky about it, you want better, cleaner air, or in this case,  softer and stickier and creamier durian. \n\nIt's not the season. November is coming up in Chengdu, and prime durian is hard to get. Summer is better. Although I was out on the street yesterday and just so luckily found some \"Maoshanwang\" Fox king durian that was so rare and so prime, in hindsight I should have filmed the video there, but those finds are really rare and I was lucky to find that durian when I did. But in general, I consider myself happy that I can chow down on durian whenever I feel like it, even if on the odd occasion  I strike out and eat some lower quality stuff. \n\nI could talk and write about durian forever. If you haven't tried it yet, I suggest trying it as soon as you can, but make sure you get a good first impression of durian, buy a fat maoshanwang variety in Penang or Kuala Lumpur, the imported frozen stuff you get in America is questionable, or so I've heard!\n\nIf you want to go to this exact shop, go to the north gate of the Southwest university of finance and economics, cross the street, walk half a block, and it will be on your left. You will love the fruit selection.\n\nThanks so much for watching and please click that subscribe button!\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious food as I can.\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

                        "description": "Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! \nFOOD RANGER MERCH NOW AVAILABLE! http://bit.ly/FOODRANGER\nFollow me on Insta: http://bit.ly/2c5ojch\nAnd subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\nIt's hard to find quality, mind-blowing Durian in China. It's because it's all exported from Malaysia and Thailand and you're never sure if it's prime quality or just medium grade. The store featured in this video usually has kept me satisfied with \"Golden Pillow\" variety, but today, something else happened.\n\nPlease like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin\n\nI come to this store every week, splurge on a fat $20 durian,  then put it in my bike basket and  go to a local tea drinking spot on the sidewalk and chow down with a cup of tea. I usually get so full that I can't eat dinner. The durian burps that come afterwards and even onto the next morning are a reminder of how much durian I ate.\n\nHowever, this time, something went wrong. I bought a nice plump durian from my favourite fruit vendor who always gifts me  things because I'm a repeat customer who buys the most expensive fruit in the store. I was ready to chow into that soft, smooth, creamy and heavenly durian, but discovered something that really saddened me, the durian wasn't that soft! The first few bites are always a little more satisfying, it's like taking that first breath of air after holding your breath for a while, it's good, but you soon become more picky about it, you want better, cleaner air, or in this case,  softer and stickier and creamier durian. \n\nIt's not the season. November is coming up in Chengdu, and prime durian is hard to get. Summer is better. Although I was out on the street yesterday and just so luckily found some \"Maoshanwang\" Fox king durian that was so rare and so prime, in hindsight I should have filmed the video there, but those finds are really rare and I was lucky to find that durian when I did. But in general, I consider myself happy that I can chow down on durian whenever I feel like it, even if on the odd occasion  I strike out and eat some lower quality stuff. \n\nI could talk and write about durian forever. If you haven't tried it yet, I suggest trying it as soon as you can, but make sure you get a good first impression of durian, buy a fat maoshanwang variety in Penang or Kuala Lumpur, the imported frozen stuff you get in America is questionable, or so I've heard!\n\nIf you want to go to this exact shop, go to the north gate of the Southwest university of finance and economics, cross the street, walk half a block, and it will be on your left. You will love the fruit selection.\n\nThanks so much for watching and please click that subscribe button!\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious food as I can.\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

Here you find Muslim cuisine that shows just how diverse China really is.  I was super lucky to try the lamb kebabs cooked on the street on my way back to Chengdu from Turkey.\nPlease like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin\n\nI had a quick layover on my way back home to Chengdu from Istanbul in Urumqi.

Turkish food is awesome! We ate it on the street, outside of a local Turkish breakfast joint! Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin\n\nWe went to the local Turkish Breakfast joint just up the hill from the Galata tower in  Taksim, just down the street from Taksim square. It was called Van Kahvalt\u0131 Evi. We paid 60 TL for a full breakfast for two, complete with way too much food. Their menu was really extensive, and offered many local specialty foods. Here are some of the local foods that we tried on the street while enjoying the Istanbul lifestyle.\n\nTurkish sausage + Scrambled eggs + Tomatoes\nPastrami fried eggs\nFried wheat flour\nTahini Molasses\nAssorted cheeses\nTomatoes + Cucumbers\nNutella\nClotted cream\nSundried tomato paste\nTurkish tea\nOlives\n\nAnd we were full! It was truly a wonderful meal! I fell in love with Turkish cuisine more and more after every meal I ate, and found Turkish people to be very friendly and hospitable. If you're thinking about visiting Turkey, go travel there for sure!

It was called Van Kahvalt\u0131 Evi. We paid 60 TL for a full breakfast for two, complete with way too much food. Their menu was really extensive, and offered many local specialty foods. Here are some of the local foods that we tried on the street while enjoying the Istanbul lifestyle.\n\nTurkish sausage + Scrambled eggs + Tomatoes\nPastrami fried eggs\nFried wheat flour\nTahini Molasses\nAssorted cheeses\nTomatoes + Cucumbers\nNutella\nClotted cream\nSundried tomato paste\nTurkish tea\nOlives\n\nAnd we were full! It was truly a wonderful meal! I fell in love with Turkish cuisine more and more after every meal I ate, and found Turkish people to be very friendly and hospitable. If you're thinking about visiting Turkey, go travel there for sure! If you are a local, you know that Turkey has some of the best food in the world!\n\nPlease like: www.facebook.com/thefoodranger\n\nAs always, thanks for the continued support and I'm so happy that you enjoy my videos.\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Sichuan, China,  eating up as much delicious food as I can.\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

CUTE! You can see cute baby pandas playing on a slide, playfighting, drinking milk, and climbing trees too. They are so cute!\n\nWhen in Chengdu, you must visit the Panda Research Base. The Panda Breeding centre has over 90 pandas, red pandas, and is in a beautiful park with over 200 acres of land to explore.  There are giant pandas in all life stages, from baby to adult. The pandas are fed around 08:00 in the morning, and eat mostly bamboo. The adults are fed apples and also \"panda bread\", which is made of oats, rice, and vitamins. All of the pandas are cared for very well at this research facility and have a very good life!\n\nWatching the pandas eating bamboo was actually really funny as well as cute. The pandas are so simple, incredibly lazy, and seem to be so happy with their life. They just lay around all day! Their lives are definitely better than ours! The baby pandas playing around was the most cute though, as they were play fighting, climbing trees, and some pandas even fell from the trees as they climbed, yet seemed unharmed and happy after the fall. \n\nAt present (May 2015) , holding a panda or sitting next to a panda is not possible. I believe there was an incident in the past and now they do not let you hold them anymore.\n\nMake sure to arrive early (07:30 is when the gates open) to buy your ticket for 58 RMB ($9.60), as the pandas are sleepy after eating bamboo and the panda research base also fills up with people, lots of people, later in the day. Many people like taking a tour to the panda base, but I recommend taking a taxi early. No need to pay extra for nothing. Also,  coming here after 10 or 10:30 is not worth it in my opinion.\n\nNot only is it a research base, it's also a museum and conservation centre. You will enjoy your time here!\n\nTo get here, tell a taxi driver \"\u718a\u732b\u57fa\u5730\" \"xiongmao jidi\". You can copy the characters onto a piece of paper or copy and paste the text from here and print it out onto a piece of paper and give it to your taxi driver. The fare should be around 60RMB or less from the city centre to the panda base.\n\nIf you liked this video, please hit that like button, share it with your friends, and leave a comment below letting me know what you thought, I appreciate all input, feedback, criticism, and comments from you!

I was slightly nervous trying this crazy awesome dish as I have never had a real frog experience before, but I was happy with the flavours and it was a welcome change after eating Hainanese chicken rice for days. I had to try something new and exciting, and when I saw this frog stall, I knew there was something unique to try. \n\nThis frog porridge stall served spicy frog, frog with spring onion, and frog with chicken essence, all boiled in a rich sauce usually served alongside  a thick rice porridge that you cover with the froggy sauce.\n\nThis froggy paradise known as Eminent Frog Porridge is located at the Lavender street hawker centre, just minutes walk from many of the major hostels, including my favourite one, Michaels Backpackers.\n\nAfter taking a 5 hour bus ride from Kuala Lumpur down to Singapore, I began by looking for food that is different from the food you find in Malaysia. However, I found that for the most part, the food in Singapore is very similar to that in Malaysia, with subtle differences between some famous dishes like Chicken rice, which I ate happily almost every day. I was lucky to spot this frog stall and immediately wanted to film it, the owner was more than happy, and he ended up giving me a free meal! Nice! Although frog porridge can be found in Malaysia, this was the first time I tried it and in Singapore I found it to be very delicious!

Malaysian Food is one of my favourites in Asia due to the diversity of Chinese, Indian, and Malay influence on all of the food, whether the local Malaysian street food in Kuala Lumpur and Penang street food, or whether dining in Mamak stalls like this famous Nasi Kandar joint, you can't go wrong! Penang food is heavenly!\n\nI was lucky enough to meet up with Kyle Le from Kyleledotnet, we enjoyed our meal together and had a great collaboration, you can check out his channel here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kyleledotnet\n\nIf you want to come to Penang to eat this mind blowing Malaysian cuisine, I suggest trying Nasi Kandar. It is famous all throughout Malaysia, but here in Penang is the birthplace. Many Nasi Kandar restaurants are open 24 hours long to serve those craving spice at any time of day. Nasi Kandar is rice covered in a huge assortment of your selection of fresh Indian curry, available with chicken, beef, mutton, and many vegetables. We ordered a fish head curry as well!\n\nI really want to come back every year to Georgetown to eat and perhaps learn some Malaysian food recipes. In Pulau Pinang (Penang), t he most famous Nasi Kandar restaurants are Nasi Kandar Line Clear or Nasi Kandar Beratur. I visited Line Clear and quite enjoyed the flavour, but I wanted to try a different place that has less hype and still had something to prove. I found Nasi Kandar Deen Maju, address below:\n\nNasi Kandar Deen Maju, Jalan Gurdwara (Brick Kiln Road)\nJalan Gurdwara, 10150 Penang, Pulau Pinang\n\nTime: 4pm-11pm\n\nI spent 3 weeks eating Penang food and afterwards I didn't want to leave. The food here is good enough for a lifetime. You can dine on Indian cuisine, Indian street food, Chinese, and Malay food every day and you will never get bored with the huge variety of food. If you come to Malaysia, you must eat in Penang and Kuala Lumpur, perhaps even take a Penang food tour or Kuala Lumur food tour from a local. The food hunt is a lot of fun here!\n\nI hope this is helpful for you the next time you go to eat Nasi Kandar!

FOOD RANGER MERCH NOW AVAILABLE! http://bit.ly/FOODRANGER\nFollow me on Insta: http://bit.ly/2c5ojch\nAnd subscribe to my channel here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ub\nIn Penang, Malaysia, the food is the best in Malaysia. Malaysian Food is one of my favourites in Asia due to the diversity of Chinese, Indian, and Malay influence on all of the food, whether the local Malaysian street food in Kuala Lumpur and Penang street food, or whether dining in Mamak stalls like this famous Nasi Kandar joint, you can't go wrong! Penang food is heavenly!\n\nI was lucky enough to meet up with Kyle Le from Kyleledotnet, we enjoyed our meal together and had a great collaboration, you can check out his channel here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kyleledotnet\n\nIf you want to come to Penang to eat this mind blowing Malaysian cuisine, I suggest trying Nasi Kandar. It is famous all throughout Malaysia, but here in Penang is the birthplace. Many Nasi Kandar restaurants are open 24 hours long to serve those craving spice at any time of day. Nasi Kandar is rice covered in a huge assortment of your selection of fresh Indian curry, available with chicken, beef, mutton, and many vegetables. We ordered a fish head curry as well!\n\nI really want to come back every year to Georgetown to eat and perhaps learn some Malaysian food recipes. In Pulau Pinang (Penang), t he most famous Nasi Kandar restaurants are Nasi Kandar Line Clear or Nasi Kandar Beratur. I visited Line Clear and quite enjoyed the flavour, but I wanted to try a different place that has less hype and still had something to prove. I found Nasi Kandar Deen Maju, address below:\n\nNasi Kandar Deen Maju, Jalan Gurdwara (Brick Kiln Road)\nJalan Gurdwara, 10150 Penang, Pulau Pinang\n\nTime: 4pm-11pm\n\nI spent 3 weeks eating Penang food and afterwards I didn't want to leave.

I set off for Chinese street food and cuisine in deep southern Sichuan province by bicycle. I rode my bike down deep into Southern China's lush and mountainous liangshan region, in search of delicious Chinese street food and Chinese food. The Chinese food really was different in this region. The liangshan region is home to Chinese Yi ethnic minority, who have their own cuisine. It was very rural and in some areas also very poor, so I had difficulty finding the yi cuisine at first. Later in the second half of the video, I found a Yi restaurant and had a Chinese food feast! The little village I visited was called Butuo, about 120 km from Xichang.\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

I set off for Chinese street food and cuisine in deep southern Sichuan province by bicycle. I rode my bike down deep into Southern China's lush and mountainous liangshan region, in search of delicious Chinese street food and Chinese food. The Chinese food really was different in this region. The liangshan region is home to Chinese Yi ethnic minority, who have their own cuisine. It was very rural and in some areas also very poor, so I had difficulty finding the yi cuisine at first. Later in the second half of the video, I found a Yi restaurant and had a Chinese food feast! The little village I visited was called Butuo, about 120 km from Xichang.\n\nMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH\n\u25ba New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg\n\u25ba Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr\n\u25ba Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG\n\u25ba Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU\n\u25ba Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb\n\u25ba Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec\n\u25ba Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc\n\u25ba Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO\n\u25ba Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD\n\u25ba Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3\n\u25ba Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS\n\u25ba How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3\n\n\u25ba MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L\n\n\u25baBEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): \nhttp://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina\n\n\u25ba MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .\n\n I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

To find out more about Uzbekistan, follow him on Instagram @bekruz_hamzaev. \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\u00bb THE UZBEK MOUNTAIN FOOD\n\n1. STREET-SIDE STALL: Dehydrated Yogurt Balls\nADDRESS: On the side of the road driving from Tashkent up Greater Chimgan Mountain\nOPEN: 8AM - 9PM\n\n\u26aaAs we wind our way up Greater Chimgan Mountain, part of the Chatkal Mountain range, we decide to stop, stretch our legs and try some local handmade food. These yummy little dehydrated yogurt balls come in an assortment of flavors including basil and chili flavored. Most of the stalls are family run, passed down generation by generation. \n\n\ud83d\udcb8PRICE: 5 USD per kg/41,610 UZS per kg \n----\n2. SAZANCHIK: Mutton Meat\nADDRESS: Chimgan Mountain of Tashkent \nOPEN: April - September | 8AM - 1AM \n\nSazanchik boasts traditional nomadic food, which guests eat in one of their yurts to get a glimpse of nomadic life in the mountains of Uzbekistan. This restaurant is known for their incredible mountain lamb, considered the wagyu of lamb in Uzbekistan. Due to adapting to the extreme weather and living conditions, the mountain lambs in Tashkent have less fat than typical lambs. \n\n\ud83c\udfd4UZBEK MOUNTAIN LAMB: Prepare the lamb using mountain herbs and lemon before wrapping it and allowing it to marinate overnight (12 hours). After fully marinating, place the lamb over a fire to roast for 6-7 hours, until the meat is fully cooked and the skin nice and crispy.  \n\n\ud83d\udcb8PRICE: 350 USD/2,911,168 UZS for whole sheep | 18 USD/149,717 UZS per kg \n----\n3. SAZANCHIK: Beshbarmak (Flat Noodles + Horse Sausage) \nADDRESS: Chimgan Mountain of Tashkent \nOPEN: April - September | 8AM - 1AM \n\nBeshbarmak means \u201cfive fingers,\u201d and refers to the fact that this traditional nomadic dish is meant to be eaten using your hands. The woman preparing this dish for us for us has been making besh barmaq for 30 years. While the dish itself is tasty, it also serves a very practical purpose: the flat noodles fill you up and keep you full for long time while the horse meat keeps you warm in the cold mountain weather. \n\n\ud83d\udd90BESHBARMAK: Mixing chicken eggs, salt and flour, create the dough for the noodles. Knead the dough and then roll it with the largest rolling pin you can find. Cut into square pieces. Boil the flat square noodles in horse stock and place them on a large round dish. The sauce contains horse fat extract, dried potatoes, onion and horse stock. Finally, pour the sauce over the noodles and then pile on horse meat, horse intestine and horse sausage.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8PRICE: 4 USD/33,281 UZS\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\ud83d\udcacCOME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM \u00bb http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySide\nFACEBOOK \u00bb http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n\ud83d\udc97SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I'm doing an all out bug tour on the streets and at the nearby Bugs Cafe. I try out some scorpion, water bugs and the most terrifying of all, the tarantula. Holy crap, I am so done with bugs now. Please lemme know if I've missed any, but I think I've got em all. \n\nAbout Sonny Side:\nI\u2019m not sponsored. I\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m just some guy who wanted to make the type of travel videos that I would want to see. This show is completely self-funded so thanks for patiently watching that five second advertisement (and read below how you can support this channel). \n\nI am a video director by trade. Each time I travel to a new country I bring a cameraman with me, usually a friend, to shoot as many episodes as possible in a short amount of time (usually a week). The rest of the time I\u2019m working as a video director/videographer in Vietnam and editing the crap out of these videos. \n\nMuch love and remember, Don't Think, Just Chew. \n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/SonnySideFilmsFan/\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I'm doing an all out bug tour on the streets and at the nearby Bugs Cafe. I try out some scorpion, water bugs and the most terrifying of all, the tarantula. Holy crap, I am so done with bugs now. Please lemme know if I've missed any, but I think I've got em all. \n\nAbout Sonny Side:\nI\u2019m not sponsored. I\u2019m not rich.

This show is completely self-funded so thanks for patiently watching that five second advertisement (and read below how you can support this channel). \n\nI am a video director by trade.

The rest of the time I\u2019m working as a video director/videographer in Vietnam and editing the crap out of these videos. \n\nMuch love and remember, Don't Think, Just Chew. \n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/SonnySideFilmsFan/\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I visit Rico's Lechon taking a tour with the bossman himself. Rico shows me how to stuff a pig, how they're roasted up and finally, and most importantly, how to eat this plate of yum. While at Rico's we also try out their famous Sisig and damn...I have seen the light. Like a junkie who's turned to jesus, I am born again with a taste of pig face. That makes sense, right? Hit up Rico's for a taste explosion. \n\nRico's Lechon: https://www.facebook.com/RicosLechonOFFICIAL/\n\n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/BestEverFoodReviewShow/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Click the BELL icon to get updated as soon as a video is uploaded. New video every Wednesday! \n\nAbout This Episode:\nToday is all about the most famous dish in all of Cebu, lechon. I visit Rico's Lechon taking a tour with the bossman himself. Rico shows me how to stuff a pig, how they're roasted up and finally, and most importantly, how to eat this plate of yum. While at Rico's we also try out their famous Sisig and damn...I have seen the light. Like a junkie who's turned to jesus, I am born again with a taste of pig face. That makes sense, right? Hit up Rico's for a taste explosion. \n\nRico's Lechon: https://www.facebook.com/RicosLechonOFFICIAL/\n\n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/BestEverFoodReviewShow/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

                    "description": "Gordon is putting out his toughest challenge yet to fellow Mentor Richard Blais....can he come up with a Next Level Recipe just by watching Gordon's viral Chicken Wing recipe? Will Richard copy Gordon or go for something in his wheelhouse? Especially since he's using the Bottom Kitchen Utensils! Either way, he's being judged by former contestant and @biteoriginals host Tini Younger! Will he impress his former mentee? \n\nWatch Next Level Chef Thursdays at 8/7c PM on @FOXTV Miss an Episode? Watch it on Hulu here: http://hulu.com/series/next-level-chef\n\nINGREDIENTS\nNeutral oil, for frying\n1 pound chicken drumsticks\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nDredge\n\u00bd cup all purpose flour\n\u00bd cup rice flour\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\nFreshly ground black pepper\nKosher salt\n\nLemon Pepper Sauce\n\u00bd cup unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons garlic paste\n2 tablespoons lemon curd\n2 tablespoons white soy sauce\n1 tablespoon hot sauce\nKosher salt\n1 teaspoon liquid seasoning \nFreshly ground black pepper \n\nGarnish\nScallions, sliced\nSesame seeds\nParsley, chopped\nLemon wedges  \n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1. Heat your oil to 350\u2109.\n2. Prep your chicken: Use a paring knife to scrape the skin of the chicken from the tip of the bone down to the flesh, exposing the bone completely. \n3. Season the chicken wings with salt and pepper.\n4. Make the dredge: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, black pepper and salt. \n5. Toss the wings in the dredge to coat completely. Shake off any excess dredge and place the wings into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165\u2109, about 5 minutes. Remove the wings to a wire rack and season with salt. \n6. Make the sauce: In a large skillet, combine half the butter, garlic paste, lemon curd, soy sauce and hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and season with salt, liquid seasoning and plenty of black pepper. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the remaining butter until it melts completely.\n7. Toss the wings in the sauce and sprinkle with sliced scallions, sesame seeds and chopped parsley. Serve with lemon wedges. \n\nThe home of Gordon Ramsay on YouTube.

Will Richard copy Gordon or go for something in his wheelhouse? Especially since he's using the Bottom Kitchen Utensils! Either way, he's being judged by former contestant and @biteoriginals host Tini Younger! Will he impress his former mentee? \n\nWatch Next Level Chef Thursdays at 8/7c PM on @FOXTV Miss an Episode?

Heat your oil to 350\u2109.\n2. Prep your chicken: Use a paring knife to scrape the skin of the chicken from the tip of the bone down to the flesh, exposing the bone completely. \n3. Season the chicken wings with salt and pepper.\n4. Make the dredge: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, black pepper and salt. \n5. Toss the wings in the dredge to coat completely. Shake off any excess dredge and place the wings into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165\u2109, about 5 minutes. Remove the wings to a wire rack and season with salt. \n6. Make the sauce: In a large skillet, combine half the butter, garlic paste, lemon curd, soy sauce and hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and season with salt, liquid seasoning and plenty of black pepper. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the remaining butter until it melts completely.\n7. Toss the wings in the sauce and sprinkle with sliced scallions, sesame seeds and chopped parsley. Serve with lemon wedges. \n\nThe home of Gordon Ramsay on YouTube.

                    "description": "It's Ramsay Redemption Time and Monti Carlo is turning around what's either an audition for prison sentence or a dry meatloaf. Monti's turning around an awful Meatloaf dish and showing you how you can make it an easy gourmet delight! \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nIngredients\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n1 small onion, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 small carrot, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 stalk celery, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1/4 cup chicken stock\n\n1/4 cup buttermilk\n\n\u00bc cup red wine\n\n1/2 cup ounces cremini mushrooms, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n2 cloves garlic,  chopped into a fine paste\n\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\n\n1 teaspoon soy sauce\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce\n\n\u00bc teaspoon paprika\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground coriander\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground cumin\n\n\u00bc teaspoon cayenne \n\n\u00bd cup panko\n\n1 lb f ground pork shoulder\n\n1 lb pounds ground chuck\n\n2 eggs\n\n1/4 cup parmesan, grated\n\n1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley, more for garnish\n\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nFor the Glaze:\n\n3/4 cup ketchup\n\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire  sauce\n\n2  teaspoons tabasco \n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n\n\u00bd teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nDirections\n\nSTEP 1\n\nIn a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sautee the onions with a generous pinch of salt until they are translucent. Add the carrot and celery and another generous pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the mixture starts to turn golden.\n\n\nSTEP 2\n\nAdd the garlic paste, paprika, cayenne, cumin, coriander, and mushrooms. Cook until the garlic starts to bloom.\n\n\nSTEP 3\n\nAdd the fish sauce, soy sauce, buttermilk, wine, and chicken stock. Cook until the liquid has reduced by half. \n\n\nSTEP 4\n\nStir in the panko and let the mixture cool. \n\n\nSTEP 5\n\nAdd the beef and pork to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix gently on low for about 20 seconds until combined. Add the eggs, parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix gently on low until combined. Test a small bit of the beef mixture for seasoning. Cook it in a pan for a minute, taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n\n\nSTEP 6\n\nTransfer the mixture to a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan. Work out any air bubbles by slamming the pan down a few times. Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the loaf a few times all the way to the bottom of the pan. This creates an escape route for any additional air bubbles. Wrap the pan in a sheet of aluminum foil big enough to cover a sheet pan and let the loaf rest in the fridge for 15 minutes. \n\n\nSTEP 7\n\nPreheat your oven to 350, with the rack in the center. When your oven is at temp, take your loaf and invert it onto a rimmed baking sheet (the top of the load should be on the sheet). Loosen the foil around the loaf pan, spread it out, then fold up the edges to trap the meatloaf\u2019s juices. \n\n\nSTEP 8\n\nBake for 30 minutes. Use a metal spatula to lift an edge of the pan off the loaf. The loaf should be set. If it is, take the sheet pan out of the oven and take the loaf pan off the loaf using oven mitts. Continue to bake the meatloaf until 140\u00b0F. \n\n\nSTEP 9\n\nRemove from the loaf from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Set the oven on broil.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small pan combine the ketchup, tomato paste, honey, vinegar, worcestershire sauce, and pepper and bring to a simmer.\n\n\nSTEP 10\n\nBrush a thin layer of the glaze on the meatloaf. Put it back in the oven and bake for 4 minutes. Glaze it again and bake until the glaze has turned a deep brown, about 4 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with any extra glaze. Garnish with fresh chopped Italian Parsley.",

                    "description": "It's Ramsay Redemption time and this week Monti is redeeming a school lunch that Gordon Ramsay burned on Twitter! How will the this Southern Spin turn out? \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nRecipe: \nDIRECTIONS\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0 and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n\nIn a pint size mason jar, mix the vinegar into the heavy cream and seal\n\n Shake it for 1 minute straight until it thickens. Congrats! You just made sour cream!\n\nStep 2\n\nGrate frozen butter in a food processor. \n\nToss together grated butter,  flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. \n\nChill in the freezer for 10 minutes.\n\n\nStep 3\n\nTake the flour and butter mixture out of the freezer and make a well in the middle.\n\nAdd the sour cream and mix JUST until a dough forms. You want a sticky, wet dough. If the dough is too dry, add a few more tablespoons of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 4\n\nLightly flour your work surface and put your dough on it. \n\nSprinkle flour over the top of the dough.\n\nLightly flour your rolling pin and roll the dough into a 9X5-inch rectangle that is about 1 inch thick. The shortest sides of the rectangle should be the left and right sides.\n\nFold the dough over each other in thirds, like a business letter.  Roll the dough lightly again into a 9 x 5-inch rectangle and repeat the letter fold 5 times total. \n\nCover the dough with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge.\n\n\nStep 5\n\nRoll the dough out lightly until it is \u00bd an inch thick. \n\nDip a 2 1/2-inch round cutter into flour, and punch straight down. \n\nRe-roll scraps, and make more rounds.\n\nLine the rounds up on your sheet pan so their sides touch.\n\nBrush the tops with a touch of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 6\n\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are a golden brown. \n\nBrush the tops with melted butter.\n\n\nTIPS FOR BISCUIT PERFECTION\n\n\n#1 KEEP IT COLD\n\nBiscuit dough is just like revenge. It\u2019s a dish best served cold.\n\nKeep your bowl and the flour in the fridge until just before mixing. Keep the butter in the freezer until it\u2019s time to grate it into the flour. \n\n\n#2 DONT MESS WITH IT TOO MUCH\n\nWhen you mix the ingredients together, do it with the least amount of stirring possible to keep gluten from forming. That way when people bite into the biscuit, they don\u2019t chip a tooth. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\n\n#3 MAKE IT FLAKY\n\nBeing a flake is bad for internet dating but AMAZING for biscuits. \n\nTo get the flakiest biscuits ever, roll the dough out gently without pressing down too much. Your hands are hot, keep them away from the dough.\n\n\n#4 DONT GET IT TWISTED\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to cut your biscuits, dip the cutter in flour so it doesn\u2019t stick to the dough. Then punch straight down, DON\u2019T TWIST.  Twisting dough keeps it from rising.\n\n\n#5 TOGETHER WE RISE\n\nPut the biscuits on your sheet pan so their sides touch. They help each other rise.\n\n\n\nGRAVY\nTOOLS\nLarge, heavy-bottomed saucepan (rounded sides)\n\nWooden Spoon with a flat edge\n\nSlotted Spoon\n\nWhisk\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces pork sausage\n\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour \n\n2 cups whole milk\n\nSalt TT\n\nBlack Pepper TT\n\nChives, sliced on the bias for garnish\n\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nStep 1\n\nPlace a large saucepan over medium-high heat.\n\nChop up the sausage into small dice. \n\nBrown the sausage. Don\u2019t stir it too much. The brown stuff stuck to the pan is called fond and that\u2019s exactly how you should feel about it. It\u2019s a flavor gold mine!\n\nOnce the sausage has cooked through, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n\n\nStep 2\n\nLower the heat to medium and scrape the bottom of the pan with the flat edge of a wooden spoon to remove all the brown spots. \n\nSprinkle in the flour. \n\nWhisk until the flour has soaked into the fat and continue to cook until you can no longer smell raw flour (about 1 minute).\n\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the milk to the pan in a small stream, whisking constantly. Don\u2019t stop stirring until the gravy thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. Work your whisk into the round sides of the saucepan to unearth any trapped flour and keep the gravy from getting lumpy.\n\nWhen the gravy is thick and glossy, add the sausage back into it and stir to incorporate. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the gravy has thickened too much, thin it with a little milk, until it\u2019s the right consistency.\n\n\nTO SERVE\nSlice biscuits in half and place the biscuit bottom on the center of a plate. \n\nPour about \u2153 cup of gravy on the top. \n\nGarnish the gravy with sliced chives. \n\nLean the biscuit top over the gravy at an angle.",

                        "description": "It's Ramsay Redemption time and this week Monti is redeeming a school lunch that Gordon Ramsay burned on Twitter! How will the this Southern Spin turn out? \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nRecipe: \nDIRECTIONS\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0 and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n\nIn a pint size mason jar, mix the vinegar into the heavy cream and seal\n\n Shake it for 1 minute straight until it thickens. Congrats! You just made sour cream!\n\nStep 2\n\nGrate frozen butter in a food processor. \n\nToss together grated butter,  flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. \n\nChill in the freezer for 10 minutes.\n\n\nStep 3\n\nTake the flour and butter mixture out of the freezer and make a well in the middle.\n\nAdd the sour cream and mix JUST until a dough forms. You want a sticky, wet dough. If the dough is too dry, add a few more tablespoons of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 4\n\nLightly flour your work surface and put your dough on it. \n\nSprinkle flour over the top of the dough.\n\nLightly flour your rolling pin and roll the dough into a 9X5-inch rectangle that is about 1 inch thick. The shortest sides of the rectangle should be the left and right sides.\n\nFold the dough over each other in thirds, like a business letter.  Roll the dough lightly again into a 9 x 5-inch rectangle and repeat the letter fold 5 times total. \n\nCover the dough with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge.\n\n\nStep 5\n\nRoll the dough out lightly until it is \u00bd an inch thick. \n\nDip a 2 1/2-inch round cutter into flour, and punch straight down. \n\nRe-roll scraps, and make more rounds.\n\nLine the rounds up on your sheet pan so their sides touch.\n\nBrush the tops with a touch of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 6\n\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are a golden brown. \n\nBrush the tops with melted butter.\n\n\nTIPS FOR BISCUIT PERFECTION\n\n\n#1 KEEP IT COLD\n\nBiscuit dough is just like revenge. It\u2019s a dish best served cold.\n\nKeep your bowl and the flour in the fridge until just before mixing. Keep the butter in the freezer until it\u2019s time to grate it into the flour. \n\n\n#2 DONT MESS WITH IT TOO MUCH\n\nWhen you mix the ingredients together, do it with the least amount of stirring possible to keep gluten from forming. That way when people bite into the biscuit, they don\u2019t chip a tooth. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\n\n#3 MAKE IT FLAKY\n\nBeing a flake is bad for internet dating but AMAZING for biscuits. \n\nTo get the flakiest biscuits ever, roll the dough out gently without pressing down too much. Your hands are hot, keep them away from the dough.\n\n\n#4 DONT GET IT TWISTED\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to cut your biscuits, dip the cutter in flour so it doesn\u2019t stick to the dough. Then punch straight down, DON\u2019T TWIST.  Twisting dough keeps it from rising.\n\n\n#5 TOGETHER WE RISE\n\nPut the biscuits on your sheet pan so their sides touch. They help each other rise.\n\n\n\nGRAVY\nTOOLS\nLarge, heavy-bottomed saucepan (rounded sides)\n\nWooden Spoon with a flat edge\n\nSlotted Spoon\n\nWhisk\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces pork sausage\n\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour \n\n2 cups whole milk\n\nSalt TT\n\nBlack Pepper TT\n\nChives, sliced on the bias for garnish\n\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nStep 1\n\nPlace a large saucepan over medium-high heat.\n\nChop up the sausage into small dice. \n\nBrown the sausage. Don\u2019t stir it too much. The brown stuff stuck to the pan is called fond and that\u2019s exactly how you should feel about it. It\u2019s a flavor gold mine!\n\nOnce the sausage has cooked through, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n\n\nStep 2\n\nLower the heat to medium and scrape the bottom of the pan with the flat edge of a wooden spoon to remove all the brown spots. \n\nSprinkle in the flour. \n\nWhisk until the flour has soaked into the fat and continue to cook until you can no longer smell raw flour (about 1 minute).\n\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the milk to the pan in a small stream, whisking constantly. Don\u2019t stop stirring until the gravy thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. Work your whisk into the round sides of the saucepan to unearth any trapped flour and keep the gravy from getting lumpy.\n\nWhen the gravy is thick and glossy, add the sausage back into it and stir to incorporate. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the gravy has thickened too much, thin it with a little milk, until it\u2019s the right consistency.\n\n\nTO SERVE\nSlice biscuits in half and place the biscuit bottom on the center of a plate. \n\nPour about \u2153 cup of gravy on the top. \n\nGarnish the gravy with sliced chives. \n\nLean the biscuit top over the gravy at an angle."

Check out her videos @hongkongfoodtours and her food tours: https://humidwithachanceoffishballs.com/ \n\n1. Sam Hui Yaat (https://maps.app.goo.gl/51xaCAgjZuSiMShN8) - This small neighborhood dim sum restaurant is a local popular spot and it\u2019s a place I always eat at when I\u2019m in Hong Kong. They have all the classics, and you can sit and enjoy some great tea as well. Prices here range from about $2 - $4 USD per basket, so you can easily have a dim sum breakfast for under $10 USD. \n\n2. Luk On Kui (https://maps.app.goo.gl/oWSoMA72Vh6FFT3f6) - Previously there was a teahouse in Hong Kong called Lin Heung Kui, which closed down (but might re-open?). It was legendary and one of the quintessential Hong Kong food experiences - loud, confusing, delicious, and never a dull moment. Luk On Kui is almost the same, and might even be run by the same people? Anyway, it\u2019s a perfect place to eat local dim sum in Hong Kong. Our total price came to 332 HKD ($42.44 USD), so about 10 - 20 USD per person, and so it ranks in the middle in terms of price.\n\n3. Lung King Heen (https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4QbNTSVtDKuHSNK7) - Lung King Heen is a 2 Michelin Star restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong lead by Executive Chef, Chef Chan Yan Tak. They are famous for a number of things, especially their renowned high end dim sum and their whole abalone puff, which is amazing. It\u2019s definitely high end, but the quality and atmosphere is spectacular. Price per person - 1,463 HKD ($187 USD).\n\nHope this gives you some ideas where to eat the best dim sum when you\u2019re in Hong Kong!\n\nFollow on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Check out her videos @hongkongfoodtours and her food tours: https://humidwithachanceoffishballs.com/ \n\n1. Sam Hui Yaat (https://maps.app.goo.gl/51xaCAgjZuSiMShN8) - This small neighborhood dim sum restaurant is a local popular spot and it\u2019s a place I always eat at when I\u2019m in Hong Kong. They have all the classics, and you can sit and enjoy some great tea as well. Prices here range from about $2 - $4 USD per basket, so you can easily have a dim sum breakfast for under $10 USD. \n\n2. Luk On Kui (https://maps.app.goo.gl/oWSoMA72Vh6FFT3f6) - Previously there was a teahouse in Hong Kong called Lin Heung Kui, which closed down (but might re-open?). It was legendary and one of the quintessential Hong Kong food experiences - loud, confusing, delicious, and never a dull moment. Luk On Kui is almost the same, and might even be run by the same people? Anyway, it\u2019s a perfect place to eat local dim sum in Hong Kong. Our total price came to 332 HKD ($42.44 USD), so about 10 - 20 USD per person, and so it ranks in the middle in terms of price.\n\n3. Lung King Heen (https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4QbNTSVtDKuHSNK7) - Lung King Heen is a 2 Michelin Star restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong lead by Executive Chef, Chef Chan Yan Tak. They are famous for a number of things, especially their renowned high end dim sum and their whole abalone puff, which is amazing. It\u2019s definitely high end, but the quality and atmosphere is spectacular. Price per person - 1,463 HKD ($187 USD).\n\nHope this gives you some ideas where to eat the best dim sum when you\u2019re in Hong Kong!\n\nFollow on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

                    "description": "\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 Indian Seafood Heaven in Mangalore: https://youtu.be/2T5wIxfF89U\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\nMANGALORE, INDIA - Welcome to the Karnataka state of India, and today we\u2019re eating the original recipe for ghee roast chicken, a type of chicken made with ghee (clarified butter) and thick red chili masala paste. It\u2019s something truly magical that will hit every taste bud you can imagine. \n\nBut first, we\u2019re going on a food tour in Mangalore to eat some Indian foods and Indian street foods you can\u2019t miss when you visit. \n\nLakshmi Nivas KT Hotel (https://maps.app.goo.gl/3uSRd44Y1yahgTQ69) - For breakfast in Mangalore we first headed to a breakfast canteen to try famous KT - Kalladka Tea, a type of local tea where the milk and tea are separate in your cup. We also tried the famous Mangalore bun, a fried bun sweetened with ripe banana. This place is legendary and highly recommended when you\u2019re in Mangalore. \n\nSitharam Chat Charmuri Corner (https://maps.app.goo.gl/VrvGRHcF3JxqJH1h8) - One of the great Indian street foods snacks in Mangalore is Charmuri - rice puffs, egg, mango, masala and this is a perfect place to try it.  \n\nPabba\u2019s Ice Cream (https://maps.app.goo.gl/BYtxC8UnobE7AdXD8) - Known to be one of the most famous ice cream parlors, not just in Mangalore, but in all of India, Pabba\u2019s Ice Cream is extremely popular. We tried some of their signature ice cream, but the best thing was their paan ice cream, which tasted exactly like a paan. \n\nMirchi Bajji - KSRTC Bus Stand - In the afternoon, one of the great Indian street food snacks is mirchi bajji, or fried green peppers, seasoned with masala and vegetables. \n\nShetty Lunch Home (https://maps.app.goo.gl/nNGbskPGVnf66CDw8) - For the main event of the day we headed to Shetty Lunch Home where they invented one of the most famous dishes in the entire state of Karnataka; ghee roast chicken. The legendary chicken ghee roast was invented by the Shetty family who actually opened their first restaurant in the nearby town of Kundapur. But in time, they opened a new and original branch in Mangalore. That branch is still owned and operated by their daughter. To make ghee roast, add a lot of ghee (clarified butter) and simmer it down with red masala chili paste, ginger and garlic, and green masala paste. You have to really simmer slowly and allow the ghee to roast, but not burn the masala until all flavors are roasted and released. Finally add the chicken and roast again. The process takes approximately 45 minutes. We ate chicken ghee roast with neer dosa, a soft rice flour pancake. The combination was unbelievably delicious. Another specialty and unlike any Indian food I\u2019ve tried is their chicken kori roti, where the roti is actually crispy before it mixed with the gravy. Shetty Lunch Home is a legendary restaurant and a place you have to eat when you\u2019re in Mangalore, India. \n\nFriends in the video: \n- Martin\n- Joel @JoelsTastyRide check out Joel\u2019s channel\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

                        "description": "\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 Indian Seafood Heaven in Mangalore: https://youtu.be/2T5wIxfF89U\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\nMANGALORE, INDIA - Welcome to the Karnataka state of India, and today we\u2019re eating the original recipe for ghee roast chicken, a type of chicken made with ghee (clarified butter) and thick red chili masala paste. It\u2019s something truly magical that will hit every taste bud you can imagine. \n\nBut first, we\u2019re going on a food tour in Mangalore to eat some Indian foods and Indian street foods you can\u2019t miss when you visit. \n\nLakshmi Nivas KT Hotel (https://maps.app.goo.gl/3uSRd44Y1yahgTQ69) - For breakfast in Mangalore we first headed to a breakfast canteen to try famous KT - Kalladka Tea, a type of local tea where the milk and tea are separate in your cup. We also tried the famous Mangalore bun, a fried bun sweetened with ripe banana. This place is legendary and highly recommended when you\u2019re in Mangalore. \n\nSitharam Chat Charmuri Corner (https://maps.app.goo.gl/VrvGRHcF3JxqJH1h8) - One of the great Indian street foods snacks in Mangalore is Charmuri - rice puffs, egg, mango, masala and this is a perfect place to try it.  \n\nPabba\u2019s Ice Cream (https://maps.app.goo.gl/BYtxC8UnobE7AdXD8) - Known to be one of the most famous ice cream parlors, not just in Mangalore, but in all of India, Pabba\u2019s Ice Cream is extremely popular. We tried some of their signature ice cream, but the best thing was their paan ice cream, which tasted exactly like a paan. \n\nMirchi Bajji - KSRTC Bus Stand - In the afternoon, one of the great Indian street food snacks is mirchi bajji, or fried green peppers, seasoned with masala and vegetables. \n\nShetty Lunch Home (https://maps.app.goo.gl/nNGbskPGVnf66CDw8) - For the main event of the day we headed to Shetty Lunch Home where they invented one of the most famous dishes in the entire state of Karnataka; ghee roast chicken. The legendary chicken ghee roast was invented by the Shetty family who actually opened their first restaurant in the nearby town of Kundapur. But in time, they opened a new and original branch in Mangalore. That branch is still owned and operated by their daughter. To make ghee roast, add a lot of ghee (clarified butter) and simmer it down with red masala chili paste, ginger and garlic, and green masala paste. You have to really simmer slowly and allow the ghee to roast, but not burn the masala until all flavors are roasted and released. Finally add the chicken and roast again. The process takes approximately 45 minutes. We ate chicken ghee roast with neer dosa, a soft rice flour pancake. The combination was unbelievably delicious. Another specialty and unlike any Indian food I\u2019ve tried is their chicken kori roti, where the roti is actually crispy before it mixed with the gravy. Shetty Lunch Home is a legendary restaurant and a place you have to eat when you\u2019re in Mangalore, India. \n\nFriends in the video: \n- Martin\n- Joel @JoelsTastyRide check out Joel\u2019s channel\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

The Rodovalho Grelhado - Grilled Turbot was fantastic, as was the Lulas - Grilled Squid, and the Pargo Grelhado - Grilled Porgi.\n\nRestaurante Os Lus\u00edadas (https://maps.app.goo.gl/W8DTiynoWQH7aSzn8) - But the highlight of this Portugal seafood tour was Restaurante Os Lus\u00edadas, an upper scale seafood restaurant that serves the absolute best and freshest seafood you can imagine. It was indeed among the best quality seafood I\u2019ve had in my life. We had Am\u00eaijoas \u00e0 Bolh\u00e3o Pato - Clams Portuguese Style, a huge seafood cocktail platter for 4, Arroz de lavagante - Lobster Rice, and Robalo ao sal - Sea Bass Salt Flamb\u00e9e! \n\nIf you love seafood, Matosinhos is a place you have to visit when you\u2019re in Portugal! \n\nThank you again to Andr\u00e9 and Ricardo from Taste Porto (https://tasteporto.com/)!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Rabat is not only the political capital of Morocco, but it\u2019s also a food capital of Morocco! \n\nA huge thank you to Moroccan Food Tour (https://moroccanfoodtour.com/) for arranging my trip to Morocco! \n\nWe started off this tour today with some street food snacks around Old Rabat. We had Rziza - Moroccan string bread, Chebakia - sweet honey pastry, sandwiches with a mix of meat and sausage all sauteed down with onions and cilantro and spices on a hot griddle, fried sardines with fried potato cutlets, and one of the tastiest Moroccan street foods - steamed cows head!  \n\nDar El Medina - For lunch Mohammed took us to a restaurant without Old Rabat that specializes and preserves traditional Moroccan food. We had some of the real classics of Moroccan cuisine like Kefta Mkawra - Meatballs in tomato sauce, Beef Tagine - Beef with prunes, Chicken Tagine - Chicken, olives, and preserved lemon, and not forgetting couscous with beef, chickpeas, and raisin onions. Many dishes were cooked in a tagine, a traditional Moroccan and North African earthenware pan. \n\nDinner at Mohamed\u2019s Home - Tonight it was an honor to have dinner at Mohamed\u2019s home, where his Mom and family cooked for us one of the most memorable meals of our entire trip to Morocco. We started with a giant salad, followed by a platter of chicken, and a literal surfboard sized platter of fish. It was outstanding, and made me realize that some of the best Moroccan food is at local homes. \n\nAgain, a huge thank you to all my friends from Moroccan Food Tour (https://moroccanfoodtour.com/) for arranging this amazing trip to Morocco. \n\nMuch more Moroccan food coming!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

We were able to see the entire process of how Joe the dog works with the truffle hunter to find and harvest white and black truffles. Black truffles are above the surface whereas white truffles are a fungus that grows underground and can only be sniffed out by dogs. It was very educational to see. We also had our first taste of Alba white truffles with a few courses at the headquarters.\n\nBovio Restaurant, La Morra, Italy (https://maps.app.goo.gl/TkDowyV6KGV36KYN9) - Next up we continued on to easily one of the world\u2019s best Italian food truffle restaurants serving Piedmont cuisine. We decided to buy our own white truffle - and we choose an 80 gram truffle for 400 Euros, after carefully choosing one. Then we ordered a bunch of different dishes, and shaved on th white truffle ourselves. It was a spectacular meal and more white truffles than I\u2019ver ever had in my life in one sitting.\n\nInternational Alba White Truffle Fair, Alba, Italy - Finally to wrap up this Italian food white truffle tour we visited the acclaimed International Alba White Truffle Fair, which is the place to go if you\u2019re interested in local products and especially white truffles.

Let\u2019s go eat!\n\nFirst of all a huge thank you to:\n- Yeison and Samantha, follow them @mytanfeet \n- Alex and Roberto from Chepe Cletas Tours\nFor taking me on this unforgettable Costa Rican food tour.\n\nMercado Central de San Jos\u00e9 (San Jos\u00e9 Central Market) - We\u2019re beginning this tour at the central market in San Jose, the best place to take in the sights, sounds and ingredients of Costa Rica. Soda Tala, San Jos\u00e9 Central Market (https://goo.gl/maps/w8k4P79QsErSDuW96) is without a doubt one of the city\u2019s best stalls, known for their Gallo Pinto (Rice and beans) - the national dish of Costa Rica. We also tried Marisquer\u00eda Brigitte for their Cadosas (Ceviche with Picaritas chips), which is something else you don\u2019t want to miss. Finally, La Sorbetera de Lolo Mora is a perfect sweet finish to any market tour in San Jose.\n\nSuper Cholo Gigante at Super Cholo Gigante, San Jos\u00e9 Meat Market - After walking around the market, we then headed to the Meat Market and in the back there\u2019s a restaurant that specializes in bocas, or small places of food. Here you can get all the classic Costa Rican foods, authentic and cooked to perfection.\n\nEmpanadas at La Empanadota - You can\u2019t come to Costa Rica without trying an empanada and everyone seems to have their favorite. When they are deep fried hot and fresh and drizzled in five sticky sauces, they are hard to resist.\n\nNext up with tried Costa Rican Coffee at Caf\u00e9 La Mancha (https://goo.gl/maps/SikNtuwndA759Uvi9) and it was the perfect afternoon boost.\n\nAnd finally we tried some unique Ice cream at the famous Coraz\u00f3n Contento Pasteler\u00eda, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (https://goo.gl/maps/KGvnTQ6Cv7pEN4wg6) \n\nAgain, thank you to Yeison and Samantha from My Tan Feet, and Alex and Roberto from Chepe Cletas Tours for taking me around San Jose, Costa Rica!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Let\u2019s go eat!\n\nFirst of all a huge thank you to:\n- Yeison and Samantha, follow them @mytanfeet \n- Alex and Roberto from Chepe Cletas Tours\nFor taking me on this unforgettable Costa Rican food tour.\n\nMercado Central de San Jos\u00e9 (San Jos\u00e9 Central Market) - We\u2019re beginning this tour at the central market in San Jose, the best place to take in the sights, sounds and ingredients of Costa Rica. Soda Tala, San Jos\u00e9 Central Market (https://goo.gl/maps/w8k4P79QsErSDuW96) is without a doubt one of the city\u2019s best stalls, known for their Gallo Pinto (Rice and beans) - the national dish of Costa Rica. We also tried Marisquer\u00eda Brigitte for their Cadosas (Ceviche with Picaritas chips), which is something else you don\u2019t want to miss. Finally, La Sorbetera de Lolo Mora is a perfect sweet finish to any market tour in San Jose.\n\nSuper Cholo Gigante at Super Cholo Gigante, San Jos\u00e9 Meat Market - After walking around the market, we then headed to the Meat Market and in the back there\u2019s a restaurant that specializes in bocas, or small places of food. Here you can get all the classic Costa Rican foods, authentic and cooked to perfection.\n\nEmpanadas at La Empanadota - You can\u2019t come to Costa Rica without trying an empanada and everyone seems to have their favorite. When they are deep fried hot and fresh and drizzled in five sticky sauces, they are hard to resist.\n\nNext up with tried Costa Rican Coffee at Caf\u00e9 La Mancha (https://goo.gl/maps/SikNtuwndA759Uvi9) and it was the perfect afternoon boost.\n\nAnd finally we tried some unique Ice cream at the famous Coraz\u00f3n Contento Pasteler\u00eda, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (https://goo.gl/maps/KGvnTQ6Cv7pEN4wg6) \n\nAgain, thank you to Yeison and Samantha from My Tan Feet, and Alex and Roberto from Chepe Cletas Tours for taking me around San Jose, Costa Rica!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

The avocados were delicious and the fresh fruits were amazing. We ate some delicious Guatemalan antojitos as Refacciones Do\u00f1a Mela, Guatemala City and some adobada and beef soup at Comedor Angelica, Guatemala City.\n\nCevicheria Los Chavos, Guatemala City (https://goo.gl/maps/nHTcpFTNXuXiDbdJA) - After some sightseeing about Guatemala City, we then headed to Cevicheria Los Chavos for a unique Guatemala City style ceviche made with some surprising ingredients - like worcestershire sauce and ketchup!\n\nHot Dogs Ejecutivos el Chino, Guatemala City - Now we\u2019re moving on to the the most famous Guatemalan street food - the shucos or Guatemalan crazy hot dogs literally! This is one of the places that started it all - everything is grilled over fire and there about a dozen meats and toppings that go on. It\u2019s a huge celebration of a hot dog all in one bun, everything chopped and layered perfectly. It was very tasty, and I especially loved the layers of guacamole avocado. \n\nShucos Campo Marte - Finally another Guatemala City street food gem is Shucos Campo Marte where there\u2019s half a dozen stalls are serving roadside shucos and the trans-metro - a huge bus sized hot dog!\n\nBig thank you to Pablo Matute from Etnica Travel (https://www.etnicatravel.com/) for arranging my trip to Guatemala.\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

Abidjan is the biggest city, and home to some incredibly tasty street bbq - including a unique vertical bbq and some of Africa\u2019s fastest BBQ! Today we\u2019re going on a full Ivorian street food tour!\n\nA huge thank you to my friend Mo Soumahoro from Belle Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire (https://www.instagram.com/bellecotedivoire/) for arranging my trip and setting up everything!\n\n1. Breakfast - we started early in the morning and headed for a rare dish of steamed corn with thick sour milk porridge. It was unique and very hearty in the morning.\n\n2. Plakali - One of the most beloved Ivorian foods is plakali, a thick stew of crabs and seafood with cow skin and okra. It\u2019s a dish with so many components and texture and absolutely incredible.\n\n3. Fried snacks - When you\u2019re in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire you don\u2019t want to miss all the delicious fried snack you\u2019ll find all over Abidjan. It was awesome to hang out with Yasmine Fofana (https://www.instagram.com/afrofoodie/)\n\n4. Pique chicken and fish and Ivorian choukouya - From this entire Abidjan street food tour, probably my favorite dish was the pique chicken and fish and the West African choukouya. The chicken and fish were skewered then marinated in spices and pepper then grilled in a sandbox - vertical bbq style. It kept the meat juicy and full of flavor. They also made delicious choukouya, where the chicken is first grilled, chopped, and mixed with onions and seasoning. It\u2019s absolutely amazing.\n\n5. Market + sandwich - Next up we continued on this West African street food tour at the market to see some local ingredients, and a tasty onion and egg sandwich.\n\n6. Brochette and bread - Another classic Abidjan street food is grilled small skewers of meat stuffed into French bread with kankankan. It\u2019s one of the fastest grilling techniques I\u2019ve seen, and unbelievably tasty.\n\n7, Grilled meat ending - Finally we had one more stop to eat more grilled meat, choukouya. Can\u2019t get enough!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

                        "description": "12 hour Ivorian street food tour in West Africa!\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ \n\nABIDJAN, COTE D\u2019IVOIRE - Welcome to the beautiful country of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (also known as Ivory Coast), in the heart of West Africa. Abidjan is the biggest city, and home to some incredibly tasty street bbq - including a unique vertical bbq and some of Africa\u2019s fastest BBQ! Today we\u2019re going on a full Ivorian street food tour!\n\nA huge thank you to my friend Mo Soumahoro from Belle Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire (https://www.instagram.com/bellecotedivoire/) for arranging my trip and setting up everything!\n\n1. Breakfast - we started early in the morning and headed for a rare dish of steamed corn with thick sour milk porridge. It was unique and very hearty in the morning.\n\n2. Plakali - One of the most beloved Ivorian foods is plakali, a thick stew of crabs and seafood with cow skin and okra. It\u2019s a dish with so many components and texture and absolutely incredible.\n\n3. Fried snacks - When you\u2019re in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire you don\u2019t want to miss all the delicious fried snack you\u2019ll find all over Abidjan. It was awesome to hang out with Yasmine Fofana (https://www.instagram.com/afrofoodie/)\n\n4. Pique chicken and fish and Ivorian choukouya - From this entire Abidjan street food tour, probably my favorite dish was the pique chicken and fish and the West African choukouya. The chicken and fish were skewered then marinated in spices and pepper then grilled in a sandbox - vertical bbq style. It kept the meat juicy and full of flavor. They also made delicious choukouya, where the chicken is first grilled, chopped, and mixed with onions and seasoning. It\u2019s absolutely amazing.\n\n5. Market + sandwich - Next up we continued on this West African street food tour at the market to see some local ingredients, and a tasty onion and egg sandwich.\n\n6. Brochette and bread - Another classic Abidjan street food is grilled small skewers of meat stuffed into French bread with kankankan. It\u2019s one of the fastest grilling techniques I\u2019ve seen, and unbelievably tasty.\n\n7, Grilled meat ending - Finally we had one more stop to eat more grilled meat, choukouya. Can\u2019t get enough!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

Get ready for some of the tastiest local food in all of Fiji!\n\nFirst of all, a huge thank you to my friend Andhy Blake, he\u2019s a TV host and Fijian producer who loves to eat and who arranged our entire trip to Fiji. Check him out https://www.instagram.com/andhy_blake/\n\nHere\u2019s all the places we visited on this ultimate Fijian food tour:\n\n1. Nausori Market, Nausori, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/JN6hSoDQ1hbFHn766)\nWe first walked around the main Nausori Market for a taste of all the local ingredients. We stopped to eat at Tee Totoka for their famous tea buns. And Finally met with Sera, who owns the greatest seafood stall at the market selling Kovu Kaikoso - Sea Clams in Coconut Milk!\n\n2. Elvis Kana Place, Nausori, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/bFB1Pz5CzCJyYVpKA)\nOne of the most delicious of all Fijian foods is rourou with mutton, raro leaves with mutton, and it was an honor to see the full cooking process before eating it.\n\n3. Namuka Village, Fiji - Continuing our tour, we visited a village just outside Nausori that\u2019s famous for making vakalolo - a cassava coconut dessert.\n\n4: Mokani Village, Fiji - Something else you have to try when you visit Fiji is called bila - fermented cassava bread, and no one does it better than here.\n\n5: The Bar Belle, Suva, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/vuZ4FEXXE1sXkUrd7?coh=178571&entry=tt)\nThe food tour isn\u2019t over, we drove on to Suva, the largest city in Fiji to eat at The Bar Belle, a laid back restaurant serving local Fijian seafood.\n\n6: Tasty BBQ, Nausori, Fiji - This Fijian food tour wouldn\u2019t be complete with some Fijian street food, and I\u2019m talking about Fijian BBQ that includes lamb chops and sausage!\n\nWe had an incredible time visiting Fiji and I can\u2019t wait to share more delicious and unseen food with you coming up in more videos in this series.\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Check him out https://www.instagram.com/andhy_blake/\n\nHere\u2019s all the places we visited on this ultimate Fijian food tour:\n\n1. Nausori Market, Nausori, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/JN6hSoDQ1hbFHn766)\nWe first walked around the main Nausori Market for a taste of all the local ingredients. We stopped to eat at Tee Totoka for their famous tea buns. And Finally met with Sera, who owns the greatest seafood stall at the market selling Kovu Kaikoso - Sea Clams in Coconut Milk!\n\n2. Elvis Kana Place, Nausori, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/bFB1Pz5CzCJyYVpKA)\nOne of the most delicious of all Fijian foods is rourou with mutton, raro leaves with mutton, and it was an honor to see the full cooking process before eating it.\n\n3. Namuka Village, Fiji - Continuing our tour, we visited a village just outside Nausori that\u2019s famous for making vakalolo - a cassava coconut dessert.\n\n4: Mokani Village, Fiji - Something else you have to try when you visit Fiji is called bila - fermented cassava bread, and no one does it better than here.\n\n5: The Bar Belle, Suva, Fiji (https://goo.gl/maps/vuZ4FEXXE1sXkUrd7?coh=178571&entry=tt)\nThe food tour isn\u2019t over, we drove on to Suva, the largest city in Fiji to eat at The Bar Belle, a laid back restaurant serving local Fijian seafood.\n\n6: Tasty BBQ, Nausori, Fiji - This Fijian food tour wouldn\u2019t be complete with some Fijian street food, and I\u2019m talking about Fijian BBQ that includes lamb chops and sausage!\n\nWe had an incredible time visiting Fiji and I can\u2019t wait to share more delicious and unseen food with you coming up in more videos in this series.\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

Babasiga Halal Bites, Nausori, Fiji \nWe\u2019re continuing this tour in Nausori, where Andhy is from and to Babasiga Halal Bites, that\u2019s legendary across Fiji for their lamb bone curry.

Today we\u2019re going to answer the question - what is Australian Food? This is my first trip to Australia, so I\u2019m excited to explore and to eat my way through Melbourne.\n\nThank you to all my friends in the video:\nHuge thank you to Chef Nick and Tess from HER Melbourne (https://her.melbourne/) for hosting me in Melbourne and for taking me around.\nChef Nick: https://www.instagram.com/nick_bennett_sourdough/\nTess: https://www.instagram.com/_tessstewart/\n\nAlso a huge thank you to Sofia Levin (https://www.instagram.com/sofiaklevin/) for showing us some of the best food in Melbourne!\n\nHere\u2019s the full Australian food tour: \n\n1: South Melbourne Market - https://goo.gl/maps/6Vefo5Ez1gNeDP5E6\nWe\u2019re starting out at South Melbourne Market to try some of the local foods available. Starting with jam donuts, meat pies, seafood, a quick oyster shot, and finally the legendary dim sim!\n\n2. Industry Beans - https://goo.gl/maps/ZEnA2so2xScVQ4CM9 \nNext up on this Australian food tour we\u2019re having coffee - and in Melbourne they take coffee culture seriously.\n\n3. Terror Twilight - https://goo.gl/maps/CcBrVwo1qrdZGECM6 \nJust like coffee culture, Australian brunch culture is very strong, and they have influenced the world with brunch, and of course - avocado toast.\n\n4: Big Esso (Mabu Mabu) - https://goo.gl/maps/5WrjENeqZS8VojrU7 \nI wouldn\u2019t want to make a video about what Australian food is without original indigenous Australian food. Big Esso is one of the few true Australian restaurants where Chef Nornie Bero from the Torres Straits serves modern Australian dishes using only local ingredients. Emu, saltbush, and green ants!\n\n5: The Napier Hotel: https://goo.gl/maps/8VguVAZWeVJFMBoM7 \nAnother part of Australian food culture is the Australian pub. Along with a classic Aussie meat pie, chicken parma (or kangaroo parma), don\u2019t miss the giant Bogan Burger.\n\n6: Gerald's Bar - https://goo.gl/maps/eJGXgUfKB3fvqXxo7 \nNext up on this food tour we\u2019re going to a local neighborhood wine bar, a favorite in Melbourne.\n\n7: Supper Inn - https://goo.gl/maps/rKnZMu8uNzRCrX9y5 \nLastly, one of the biggest parts of Australia is the diversity and people from around the world who have migrated to Australia, including many Chinese. Melbourne is home to a substantial Chinatown and we\u2019re eating at one of the absolutely classics.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s so much more to learn, this was an introduction to learning what Australian food is!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Today we\u2019re going to answer the question - what is Australian Food? This is my first trip to Australia, so I\u2019m excited to explore and to eat my way through Melbourne.\n\nThank you to all my friends in the video:\nHuge thank you to Chef Nick and Tess from HER Melbourne (https://her.melbourne/) for hosting me in Melbourne and for taking me around.\nChef Nick: https://www.instagram.com/nick_bennett_sourdough/\nTess: https://www.instagram.com/_tessstewart/\n\nAlso a huge thank you to Sofia Levin (https://www.instagram.com/sofiaklevin/) for showing us some of the best food in Melbourne!\n\nHere\u2019s the full Australian food tour: \n\n1: South Melbourne Market - https://goo.gl/maps/6Vefo5Ez1gNeDP5E6\nWe\u2019re starting out at South Melbourne Market to try some of the local foods available. Starting with jam donuts, meat pies, seafood, a quick oyster shot, and finally the legendary dim sim!\n\n2. Industry Beans - https://goo.gl/maps/ZEnA2so2xScVQ4CM9 \nNext up on this Australian food tour we\u2019re having coffee - and in Melbourne they take coffee culture seriously.\n\n3. Terror Twilight - https://goo.gl/maps/CcBrVwo1qrdZGECM6 \nJust like coffee culture, Australian brunch culture is very strong, and they have influenced the world with brunch, and of course - avocado toast.\n\n4: Big Esso (Mabu Mabu) - https://goo.gl/maps/5WrjENeqZS8VojrU7 \nI wouldn\u2019t want to make a video about what Australian food is without original indigenous Australian food. Big Esso is one of the few true Australian restaurants where Chef Nornie Bero from the Torres Straits serves modern Australian dishes using only local ingredients. Emu, saltbush, and green ants!\n\n5: The Napier Hotel: https://goo.gl/maps/8VguVAZWeVJFMBoM7 \nAnother part of Australian food culture is the Australian pub. Along with a classic Aussie meat pie, chicken parma (or kangaroo parma), don\u2019t miss the giant Bogan Burger.\n\n6: Gerald's Bar - https://goo.gl/maps/eJGXgUfKB3fvqXxo7 \nNext up on this food tour we\u2019re going to a local neighborhood wine bar, a favorite in Melbourne.\n\n7: Supper Inn - https://goo.gl/maps/rKnZMu8uNzRCrX9y5 \nLastly, one of the biggest parts of Australia is the diversity and people from around the world who have migrated to Australia, including many Chinese. Melbourne is home to a substantial Chinatown and we\u2019re eating at one of the absolutely classics.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s so much more to learn, this was an introduction to learning what Australian food is!\n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n\ud83d\udc55 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n\ud83c\udf36 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

Today I\u2019m hanging out with my friend Yuji-San and we\u2019re going to take you on an ultimate Okinawan food tour!\n\nThanks to my friend Yuji-San for taking me about Naha: https://www.instagram.com/hotel_manager_jt/ \n\n1. MEGURO miso soup stand: https://goo.gl/maps/rGGLu9RtcAL23eHo9 - We started off for the greatest ever rice ball and craft miso soup. It was a totally new experience and appreciation for miso soup.\nTotal price - 2,800 JPY\n\n2. Tofu Soba at Takaesu Soba: https://goo.gl/maps/mD4vzTqqHxaJdCSL8 - In Okinawa, soba is totally different from the buckwheat noodles you get in other parts of Japan. Okinawan soba is something nearly everyone eats for lunch and it\u2019s more similar to ramen with wheat noodles and pork ribs. We went to this special place for their tofu soba.\nTotal price - 2,770 JPY\n\n3. Ice snow cones at Fujiya Tomari: https://goo.gl/maps/Q8SF83Vjq6FoUUwH9 - Another thing you have to try in Okinawa is their snow cones.\nPrice - 1,350 JPY for everything\n\n4. Okinawan Izakaya at Urizun: https://goo.gl/maps/iwbuKjfUUG1yxNNK7 - In order get a taste of traditional Okinawan food, we went to Urizun. Again, dishes were totally different from anywhere else I\u2019ve bee.\nPrice - 9,353 JPY for everything\n\n5. Goat Sashimi at Nijuban (20th) Goat Restaurant: https://goo.gl/maps/UwNcUyueA6eVYKBw7 - Finally there was one meal I was not going to leave Okinawa without trying - goat sashimi!\nPrice - 3,400 JPY for everything\n\nOkinawa is a wonderful island to visit with a truly unique food culture.

Today I\u2019m hanging out with my friend Yuji-San and we\u2019re going to take you on an ultimate Okinawan food tour!\n\nThanks to my friend Yuji-San for taking me about Naha: https://www.instagram.com/hotel_manager_jt/ \n\n1. MEGURO miso soup stand: https://goo.gl/maps/rGGLu9RtcAL23eHo9 - We started off for the greatest ever rice ball and craft miso soup. It was a totally new experience and appreciation for miso soup.\nTotal price - 2,800 JPY\n\n2. Tofu Soba at Takaesu Soba: https://goo.gl/maps/mD4vzTqqHxaJdCSL8 - In Okinawa, soba is totally different from the buckwheat noodles you get in other parts of Japan. Okinawan soba is something nearly everyone eats for lunch and it\u2019s more similar to ramen with wheat noodles and pork ribs. We went to this special place for their tofu soba.\nTotal price - 2,770 JPY\n\n3. Ice snow cones at Fujiya Tomari: https://goo.gl/maps/Q8SF83Vjq6FoUUwH9 - Another thing you have to try in Okinawa is their snow cones.\nPrice - 1,350 JPY for everything\n\n4. Okinawan Izakaya at Urizun: https://goo.gl/maps/iwbuKjfUUG1yxNNK7 - In order get a taste of traditional Okinawan food, we went to Urizun. Again, dishes were totally different from anywhere else I\u2019ve bee.\nPrice - 9,353 JPY for everything\n\n5. Goat Sashimi at Nijuban (20th) Goat Restaurant: https://goo.gl/maps/UwNcUyueA6eVYKBw7 - Finally there was one meal I was not going to leave Okinawa without trying - goat sashimi!\nPrice - 3,400 JPY for everything\n\nOkinawa is a wonderful island to visit with a truly unique food culture.

They have done an amazing job to preserve the culture of \u201cyatai\u201d or portable street food stalls that set up in the evening across the city. Tonight we\u2019re going on an ultimate Japanese street food tour in Fukuoka, going to 5 different place for 5 Japanese dishes and I can\u2019t wait to share all the food with you now.\n\n#1 Yaki Ramen\nLocation: Kokinchan: https://goo.gl/maps/AMGdvUadJR6JbFwi6 - We\u2019re starting off with a famous yatai stall where they invented the original yaki ramen - or fried ramen. It was definitely new to me, I thought it would be more of a dry fried noodles, but it was rather a wet and soup fried noodle dish. Amazing, as were the other dishes.\nPrice - 2,650 JPY for everything\n\n#2 Gyoza\nLocation: Yatai Mamichan: https://goo.gl/maps/dwSFjcZea59H947D8 - You can go on a Japanese street food tour without eating gyoza, and Yatai Mamichan is one of the best places to eat them. The chef is amazingly skilling, cooking everything on his own and darting from station to station. Part of the great thing about eating at Yatai is being right in front of the cooking and interacting with the chef.\nPrice - 8,450 JPY for 5 people (we ordered a lot and lots of drinks)\n\n#3 Tempura - Next, I\u2019m not totally sure of the name of this place, but they are known for their tempura, battered and deep fried seafood and vegetables. It was a little oily, but still quite tasty.\nPrice - 1,100 JPY\n\n#4 Hakata Ramen\nLocation: Yatai Kiryu: https://goo.gl/maps/RB5UQkK8wFUG8TTX6 - Hakata ramen, or tonkotsu ramen is one of the most common and popular dishes in Fukuoka and you\u2019ll find Hakata ramen served at nearly all yatai food stalls.\nPrice - 650 JPY per bowl\n\n#5 Yakitori\nLocation: Yatai Kawachan: https://goo.gl/maps/5jzCzVt4VwHJ7hGS7 - Finally we ate at a place called Yatai Kawachan, known for their yakitori, or grilled chicken skewers. It was a quite a selection of different skewers from gizzard to hot dog.\nTotal price - 4,400 JPY for everything with drinks\n\nThe yatai street food culture in Fukuoka is one of the great Japanese food scenes in Japan. Let\u2019s hope generations continue to take pride in their food stalls and preserve the yatai culture.\n\nThank you to Visit Kyushu (https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/) for helping me organize this food tour.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd",

They have done an amazing job to preserve the culture of \u201cyatai\u201d or portable street food stalls that set up in the evening across the city. Tonight we\u2019re going on an ultimate Japanese street food tour in Fukuoka, going to 5 different place for 5 Japanese dishes and I can\u2019t wait to share all the food with you now.\n\n#1 Yaki Ramen\nLocation: Kokinchan: https://goo.gl/maps/AMGdvUadJR6JbFwi6 - We\u2019re starting off with a famous yatai stall where they invented the original yaki ramen - or fried ramen. It was definitely new to me, I thought it would be more of a dry fried noodles, but it was rather a wet and soup fried noodle dish. Amazing, as were the other dishes.\nPrice - 2,650 JPY for everything\n\n#2 Gyoza\nLocation: Yatai Mamichan: https://goo.gl/maps/dwSFjcZea59H947D8 - You can go on a Japanese street food tour without eating gyoza, and Yatai Mamichan is one of the best places to eat them. The chef is amazingly skilling, cooking everything on his own and darting from station to station. Part of the great thing about eating at Yatai is being right in front of the cooking and interacting with the chef.\nPrice - 8,450 JPY for 5 people (we ordered a lot and lots of drinks)\n\n#3 Tempura - Next, I\u2019m not totally sure of the name of this place, but they are known for their tempura, battered and deep fried seafood and vegetables. It was a little oily, but still quite tasty.\nPrice - 1,100 JPY\n\n#4 Hakata Ramen\nLocation: Yatai Kiryu: https://goo.gl/maps/RB5UQkK8wFUG8TTX6 - Hakata ramen, or tonkotsu ramen is one of the most common and popular dishes in Fukuoka and you\u2019ll find Hakata ramen served at nearly all yatai food stalls.\nPrice - 650 JPY per bowl\n\n#5 Yakitori\nLocation: Yatai Kawachan: https://goo.gl/maps/5jzCzVt4VwHJ7hGS7 - Finally we ate at a place called Yatai Kawachan, known for their yakitori, or grilled chicken skewers. It was a quite a selection of different skewers from gizzard to hot dog.\nTotal price - 4,400 JPY for everything with drinks\n\nThe yatai street food culture in Fukuoka is one of the great Japanese food scenes in Japan. Let\u2019s hope generations continue to take pride in their food stalls and preserve the yatai culture.\n\nThank you to Visit Kyushu (https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/) for helping me organize this food tour.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd"

Today I\u2019m taking you on an ultimate local Saudi Arabian food tour of Riyadh, we\u2019ll be eating some of the greatest dishes, food you don\u2019t want to miss!\n\nHere are all the locations featured in this food review:\n\n1. Fawal Abo Salem (https://goo.gl/maps/TyzPpWvigqEM5JcZ6)  - We\u2019re beginning this Saudi Arabian food tour in Riyadh with a staple breakfast - ful - mashed fava beans that likely originate in Egypt, but are widely popular throughout the entire region. Ful medames at Fawal Abo Salem for breakfast is some of the best in the entire city - and I was blown away by the quality and flavor, paired with the freshly baked bread.\n\n2. Camel liver - I\u2019m not totally sure of the name of this place, but they are famous for their fried camel liver, sauteed down with onions and peppers. It\u2019s truly tasty, right off the hot griddle with fresh bread and a dash of hot sauce.\n\n3. Alnaqaa Falafel & Hummus (https://goo.gl/maps/SzCLzQTAteZVUHc76) - To eat the best Falafel and Hummus and Riyadh, you have to go to Alnaqaa - it\u2019s absolutely legendary, and it felt as though I was right back on the streets of Beirut. One of their specialties is a giant falafel stuffed with caramelized onions. And make sure you order the entire falafel mountain!\n\n4. Kebda Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/6advt5emgE6eoUfRA) - This Riyadh food tour is not complete with only camel liver - another popular liver to eat is lamb liver, and this time it\u2019s not served on a plate, but with bread, sandwich style. Some of the tastiest lamb liver you\u2019ll ever try!\n\n5. Sudah Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/FprxbXE6A4TdMmkdA) - To begin this food tour and to end this food tour, it was a privilege to spend some time at Sudah Restaurant to learn about Haneed, an Arabian food that at this restaurant originates from Aseer Province. They still make it the traditional way, loading parted out young lambs into an underground oven, layered with a specific type of hay that holds in the moisture and gives a distinct fragrance. The result is smokey lamb served over a mountain of rice, that literally melts in your mouth with the smoky fragrance of the hay. It was an unforgettable meal experience in Saudi Arabia!\n\nAnd that wraps up this ultimate Saudi Arabian food tour in Riyadh, what a day of delicious food. \n\nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)",

I\u2019m hanging out with my friend @misho_baeshen and we\u2019ll be going to eat some of the best seafood in the city, exploring the old town of Al-Balad, and finishing with some local favorite foods for dinner.\n\nThanks to Hisham: https://www.youtube.com/@misho_baeshen/\n\nHere are the places we went in this Jeddah food tour: \n\nAl Basali Seafood Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/eqv3xRXNys2CzbMB7) - First, the main food mission of the day is to eat some of the best seafood in Jeddah, and so we\u2019re heading to the historical area of Al-Balad to eat at Al Basali Seafood Restaurant that\u2019s been open since 1949, for three generations! They specialize in locally caught seafood from the Red Sea and all seafoods are displayed in a cabinet so you can see what you want to choose. Along with crabs, shrimp and lobster, one of the greatest fish from the Red Sea is a najel fish. The fish was deep fried and seasoned afterwards with a light blend of spices. The entire meal was fantastic, everything fresh, nothing overpowering the delicious seafood. I also really enjoyed the rice, which Hisham mentioned is only eaten when you eat fish.\n\nAl-Balad - Is the historical center of Jeddah and also a  UNESCO World Heritage site. Walking through the narrow streets, it\u2019s truly magnificent to see the preservation of the old town and how it\u2019s still functioning in everyday life. We stopped at a museum and for a quick cup of Saudi coffee while we explored.\n\nOlfat Al Halawani (https://goo.gl/maps/Hp2AGJHYWRsAYwfU7) - Motabbaq is an Arabian food that\u2019s influenced so many similar dishes around the world. To make it, they slap out thin dough, fill it with a combination of herbs, eggs, minced meat, and spices, wrap it up into a packet and cook it over a hot plate. When you eat it, you sprinkle it first with lemon, and chase it with a green chili. It was fantastic, highly recommended, and it\u2019s especially famous to eat in the evening in Jeddah.\n\nLamb head mandi - For one more night snack we stopped at a restaurant to eat lamb head mandi, a dish where the lamb is falling off the bone - quite literally falling off the head - it\u2019s then chopped up and sprinkled with cumin and salt. Each bite melts in your mouth, from the tongue to the cheeks.\n\nJeddah is an incredible city to visit in Saudi Arabia with an exciting food culture!\n\nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)",

I\u2019m hanging out with my friend @misho_baeshen and we\u2019ll be going to eat some of the best seafood in the city, exploring the old town of Al-Balad, and finishing with some local favorite foods for dinner.\n\nThanks to Hisham: https://www.youtube.com/@misho_baeshen/\n\nHere are the places we went in this Jeddah food tour: \n\nAl Basali Seafood Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/eqv3xRXNys2CzbMB7) - First, the main food mission of the day is to eat some of the best seafood in Jeddah, and so we\u2019re heading to the historical area of Al-Balad to eat at Al Basali Seafood Restaurant that\u2019s been open since 1949, for three generations! They specialize in locally caught seafood from the Red Sea and all seafoods are displayed in a cabinet so you can see what you want to choose. Along with crabs, shrimp and lobster, one of the greatest fish from the Red Sea is a najel fish. The fish was deep fried and seasoned afterwards with a light blend of spices. The entire meal was fantastic, everything fresh, nothing overpowering the delicious seafood. I also really enjoyed the rice, which Hisham mentioned is only eaten when you eat fish.\n\nAl-Balad - Is the historical center of Jeddah and also a  UNESCO World Heritage site. Walking through the narrow streets, it\u2019s truly magnificent to see the preservation of the old town and how it\u2019s still functioning in everyday life. We stopped at a museum and for a quick cup of Saudi coffee while we explored.\n\nOlfat Al Halawani (https://goo.gl/maps/Hp2AGJHYWRsAYwfU7) - Motabbaq is an Arabian food that\u2019s influenced so many similar dishes around the world. To make it, they slap out thin dough, fill it with a combination of herbs, eggs, minced meat, and spices, wrap it up into a packet and cook it over a hot plate. When you eat it, you sprinkle it first with lemon, and chase it with a green chili. It was fantastic, highly recommended, and it\u2019s especially famous to eat in the evening in Jeddah.\n\nLamb head mandi - For one more night snack we stopped at a restaurant to eat lamb head mandi, a dish where the lamb is falling off the bone - quite literally falling off the head - it\u2019s then chopped up and sprinkled with cumin and salt. Each bite melts in your mouth, from the tongue to the cheeks.\n\nJeddah is an incredible city to visit in Saudi Arabia with an exciting food culture!\n\nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)"

Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate pig tour to eat the best lechon in the Philippines - maybe the entire world! It\u2019s going to be a day of crispy skin, juicy pork, and the action is going to be insane!\n \n@StanlyOnMedia  - First of all thank you to my friend Stanly from Stanly On Media - he\u2019s the king of lechon and he\u2019s been to so many lechon spots in and around Cebu so there\u2019s no better person to go on a lechon tour with. Go follow Stanly for many more lechon recommendations in the Philippines: https://www.youtube.com/@StanlyonMedia\n\nHere are all the places we went in this Philippines street food tour:\n\nGogoes Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/dkhyaPNKmyEjjwhu5) - First up is Gogoes lechon located north of Cebu. We arrived at 5 am to see the process of them roasting their lechon. They fill up the belly of the pig with sea salt and a combination of spices that includes ginger and especially green onions. The pigs roast for 3 - 4 hours, carefully being turned as they roast so the skin cooks and crispfies perfectly. It was sensational and a perfect way to start this ultimate Filipino lechon tour. (Price - they wouldn\u2019t charge us)\n\nRuthy's Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/mCwqJYFZiv73MgYQ7) - Next up we headed to Talisay, known as the birthplace of lechon, and where the original lechoneros come from. Stanly first took me to Ruthy\u2019s one of the standards of lechon - packed and they fly through the pigs. We chopped up a 3 kilo belly section of the pig. The skin was insanely crispy, salty, and full of juicy green onions. Price - 2,940 pesos\n\nLolo Soy's Lechon House - Finally, one of the greatest lechon\u2019s in all of the Philippines, Lolo Soy's Lechon House. They fly through pigs and they had already sold over 20 pigs by the time we arrived. The action is out of control! We ordered a kilo and they also gave us some of the feet, plus some of the blood stew. Price - 750 per kg, we had 1 kg\n\nParaz Native Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/iTpyTW6znqGsyp7J8) - For our last stop on this ultimate Filipino lechon tour we drove down to Carcar, another famous lechon city. We went to Paraz Native Lechon where they sell over 50 pigs a day, and they use native natural pigs. The pigs are still roasted over coals using traditional bamboo skewers. They chop it up, it\u2019s so insanely juicy and then they drizzle on the drippings with all the onions. Additionally, they are known for their chili vinegar, which is some of the best you\u2019ll have anywhere.\n\nThis was one of the greatest days of eating pig in my lechon, Cebu lechon really is the king of roast pig!\n\nThank you again to @StanlyOnMedia for taking me on this ultimate tour of the lechon in the Philippines!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)",

Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate pig tour to eat the best lechon in the Philippines - maybe the entire world! It\u2019s going to be a day of crispy skin, juicy pork, and the action is going to be insane!\n \n@StanlyOnMedia  - First of all thank you to my friend Stanly from Stanly On Media - he\u2019s the king of lechon and he\u2019s been to so many lechon spots in and around Cebu so there\u2019s no better person to go on a lechon tour with. Go follow Stanly for many more lechon recommendations in the Philippines: https://www.youtube.com/@StanlyonMedia\n\nHere are all the places we went in this Philippines street food tour:\n\nGogoes Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/dkhyaPNKmyEjjwhu5) - First up is Gogoes lechon located north of Cebu. We arrived at 5 am to see the process of them roasting their lechon. They fill up the belly of the pig with sea salt and a combination of spices that includes ginger and especially green onions. The pigs roast for 3 - 4 hours, carefully being turned as they roast so the skin cooks and crispfies perfectly. It was sensational and a perfect way to start this ultimate Filipino lechon tour. (Price - they wouldn\u2019t charge us)\n\nRuthy's Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/mCwqJYFZiv73MgYQ7) - Next up we headed to Talisay, known as the birthplace of lechon, and where the original lechoneros come from. Stanly first took me to Ruthy\u2019s one of the standards of lechon - packed and they fly through the pigs. We chopped up a 3 kilo belly section of the pig. The skin was insanely crispy, salty, and full of juicy green onions. Price - 2,940 pesos\n\nLolo Soy's Lechon House - Finally, one of the greatest lechon\u2019s in all of the Philippines, Lolo Soy's Lechon House. They fly through pigs and they had already sold over 20 pigs by the time we arrived. The action is out of control! We ordered a kilo and they also gave us some of the feet, plus some of the blood stew. Price - 750 per kg, we had 1 kg\n\nParaz Native Lechon (https://goo.gl/maps/iTpyTW6znqGsyp7J8) - For our last stop on this ultimate Filipino lechon tour we drove down to Carcar, another famous lechon city. We went to Paraz Native Lechon where they sell over 50 pigs a day, and they use native natural pigs. The pigs are still roasted over coals using traditional bamboo skewers. They chop it up, it\u2019s so insanely juicy and then they drizzle on the drippings with all the onions. Additionally, they are known for their chili vinegar, which is some of the best you\u2019ll have anywhere.\n\nThis was one of the greatest days of eating pig in my lechon, Cebu lechon really is the king of roast pig!\n\nThank you again to @StanlyOnMedia for taking me on this ultimate tour of the lechon in the Philippines!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)"

But instead of eating at the restaurant, they took the bbq and all the ingredients to the lake where they set up a huge lakeside Armenian bbq.

There was over 13 types of kebabs and so many other side dishes as well, including dolma!\n\nIt was a meal and a setting in nature that I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nAgain, thank you to Kristo and Culinary Backstreets for arranging - https://culinarybackstreets.com/ (code: migrationology10)\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)"

I\u2019m so excited to finally be here. So many of you have written to me over the years inviting me to visit for the amazing food and culture, so it\u2019s really an honor to finally be here and to explore the incredible food. Let\u2019s get started eating, we\u2019re jumping straight into a massive 20 hour day of eating local street food!\n\nHuge thank you to #visitTrinidad for inviting me to Trinidad and Tobago and for making this trip happen!\n\nFriends in the video: \nZaak (Foodie Tales with Zaak): https://www.instagram.com/foodietaleswithzaak/\nBaidawi (Eatahfood): https://www.instagram.com/eatahfoodtt/\nDavid (D\u2019Market Movers): https://www.instagram.com/dmarketmovers/ \nBrent (Hungry Belly 868): https://www.instagram.com/hungrybelly868/\n\nAnd here\u2019s everything we did in the video, and all the food we ate:\n\nCentral Market - We started off today at the Central Market in Port of Spain, bright and early in the morning before 7 am. And with Baidawi and David, who go to the market every weekend to do their shopping and have breakfast, we were in the right hands. After exploring the market and the amazing produce and ingredients that go into food in Trinidad and Tobago we then headed to the food court for some local fish broth and cow heel soup.\n\nEatAhFood - Baidawi makes fantastic food videos, especially recipes, and so we bought ingredients and headed back to his house to cook Callaloo, an Afro Caribbean food of simmered down taro leaves and pumpkin and coconut milk. It was so good!\n\nRoti - One of the greatest of all Trinidadian foods is roti - different from anywhere else. The rotis are huge and fresh and then stuffed with pumpkin, potato, and curry of your choice. An afternoon bulging roti with Zaak, was absolutely delicious.\n\nQueens Park Savannah - Port of Spain - To continue on with this street food tour in Trinidad and Tobago, we went to Queens Park Savannah for a coconut and then continued on to the evening street food market to sample a bunch of different local foods - everything from doubles to pholourie and roast fish.\n\nYousef Gyro (https://goo.gl/maps/vJkVQL9S5zMSSnGw5) - Trinidad and Tobago is so diverse and there\u2019s even a local Middle Eastern population including Yousef Gyro, owned by descendants of Syrian immigrants. They make all sorts of wraps and gyros and combinations you won\u2019t find anywhere else. This is the ultimate late night food in Trinidad!\n\nDass Doubles Factory (https://goo.gl/maps/X6yvzWiQi9WscWdc6) - We did have a quick doubles at the street food night market, but we went to Dass Doubles Factory for the real deal late night doubles. They made the barras fresh and load them up with heavy peppa sauce and delicious curry chickpeas. \n\nHadco Phase II Pan Groove Orchestra Pan Yard (https://www.instagram.com/hadcophase2pangroove/) - Finally to complete this day we were treated to a panyard lime to see the ultimate instrument of Trinidad and Tobago - steel pan! It was so cool to see and an amazing way to wrap up this ultimate street food tour - and they have delicious food!\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who made this video possible and to #visitTrinidad!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US.

I\u2019m so excited to finally be here. So many of you have written to me over the years inviting me to visit for the amazing food and culture, so it\u2019s really an honor to finally be here and to explore the incredible food. Let\u2019s get started eating, we\u2019re jumping straight into a massive 20 hour day of eating local street food!\n\nHuge thank you to #visitTrinidad for inviting me to Trinidad and Tobago and for making this trip happen!\n\nFriends in the video: \nZaak (Foodie Tales with Zaak): https://www.instagram.com/foodietaleswithzaak/\nBaidawi (Eatahfood): https://www.instagram.com/eatahfoodtt/\nDavid (D\u2019Market Movers): https://www.instagram.com/dmarketmovers/ \nBrent (Hungry Belly 868): https://www.instagram.com/hungrybelly868/\n\nAnd here\u2019s everything we did in the video, and all the food we ate:\n\nCentral Market - We started off today at the Central Market in Port of Spain, bright and early in the morning before 7 am. And with Baidawi and David, who go to the market every weekend to do their shopping and have breakfast, we were in the right hands. After exploring the market and the amazing produce and ingredients that go into food in Trinidad and Tobago we then headed to the food court for some local fish broth and cow heel soup.\n\nEatAhFood - Baidawi makes fantastic food videos, especially recipes, and so we bought ingredients and headed back to his house to cook Callaloo, an Afro Caribbean food of simmered down taro leaves and pumpkin and coconut milk. It was so good!\n\nRoti - One of the greatest of all Trinidadian foods is roti - different from anywhere else. The rotis are huge and fresh and then stuffed with pumpkin, potato, and curry of your choice. An afternoon bulging roti with Zaak, was absolutely delicious.\n\nQueens Park Savannah - Port of Spain - To continue on with this street food tour in Trinidad and Tobago, we went to Queens Park Savannah for a coconut and then continued on to the evening street food market to sample a bunch of different local foods - everything from doubles to pholourie and roast fish.\n\nYousef Gyro (https://goo.gl/maps/vJkVQL9S5zMSSnGw5) - Trinidad and Tobago is so diverse and there\u2019s even a local Middle Eastern population including Yousef Gyro, owned by descendants of Syrian immigrants. They make all sorts of wraps and gyros and combinations you won\u2019t find anywhere else. This is the ultimate late night food in Trinidad!\n\nDass Doubles Factory (https://goo.gl/maps/X6yvzWiQi9WscWdc6) - We did have a quick doubles at the street food night market, but we went to Dass Doubles Factory for the real deal late night doubles. They made the barras fresh and load them up with heavy peppa sauce and delicious curry chickpeas. \n\nHadco Phase II Pan Groove Orchestra Pan Yard (https://www.instagram.com/hadcophase2pangroove/) - Finally to complete this day we were treated to a panyard lime to see the ultimate instrument of Trinidad and Tobago - steel pan! It was so cool to see and an amazing way to wrap up this ultimate street food tour - and they have delicious food!\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who made this video possible and to #visitTrinidad!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US.

Today I\u2019m hanging out with my friends from reAzerbaijan, and we\u2019re taking you on an ultimate and extreme street food tour - it\u2019s going to be meaty! #ExperienceAzerbaijan #Baku\n\nFirst of all, a huge thank you to reAzerbaijan for arranging my trip to Azerbaijan, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without them.\n\nreAzerbaijan: https://www.instagram.com/reazerbaijan/\nAdnan: https://www.instagram.com/adnanhuseynn/\n\nAs Adnan and Farhad explained to me, unfortunately during the Soviet period, Azerbaijan wasn\u2019t able to develop their street food culture that much and creativity was omitted. When Azerbaijan broke away from the Soviet Union, it was the Turkish who influenced much of the Azerbaijani street food culture. So you will definitely find some similarities, and yet some differences.\n\nWe started this extreme street food tour in Baku by going to one of the oldest Soviet style cafes for a quick piroshky on the go. It was pretty oily, but pretty tasty especially when drenched in tomato sauce.\n\nAmin Kabab - Next stop on this food tour, we went to Amin Kabab, a small neighborhood kebab grill for a quick Lyulya kebab, or chopped meat kebab.\n\nEskulap Restoran - If you\u2019re looking for one of the best local Azerbaijan kebab meat restaurants in Baku, this is the spot. Adnan explained it\u2019s a legendary restaurant he\u2019s been coming to since he was a kid. They specialize in all things lamb, and along with a variety of stews and braised dishes, one of their specialties is the Khan Kebab, lamb liver wrapped in caul fat and grilled. I also loved the lamb braised in sour plums and barberries and the insane dessert kebab of ground walnuts and lamb fat. What a meal!\n\nTo continue this extreme street food tour in Baku we headed to a lamb street where lambs hang on the street, you choose your cut from nose to tail. The organs and jaws are some of the most popular items here. We tried lamb jaws and testicles - both of which were pretty tasty.\n\nK\u00f6z Halil Usta - Finally to complete this food tour, we had to eat at K\u00f6z Halil Usta for tantuni, a Turkish in origin food, but one of the most popular street foods in Azerbaijan. They fry up beef slices with spices and sunflower oil and wrap into your choice of bread or lavash. It\u2019s something you could watch all day being made and it\u2019s so incredibly addictive.\n\nAnd that wraps up Azerbaijani food tour in Baku. It\u2019s an incredible city and the lamb and meats are spectacular!\n\nThank you again to Adnan from reAzerbaijan for arranging my trip!\nAdnan: https://www.instagram.com/adnanhuseynn/\nreAzerbaijan: https://www.instagram.com/reazerbaijan/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US.

Today I\u2019m hanging out with my friends from reAzerbaijan, and we\u2019re taking you on an ultimate and extreme street food tour - it\u2019s going to be meaty! #ExperienceAzerbaijan #Baku\n\nFirst of all, a huge thank you to reAzerbaijan for arranging my trip to Azerbaijan, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without them.\n\nreAzerbaijan: https://www.instagram.com/reazerbaijan/\nAdnan: https://www.instagram.com/adnanhuseynn/\n\nAs Adnan and Farhad explained to me, unfortunately during the Soviet period, Azerbaijan wasn\u2019t able to develop their street food culture that much and creativity was omitted. When Azerbaijan broke away from the Soviet Union, it was the Turkish who influenced much of the Azerbaijani street food culture. So you will definitely find some similarities, and yet some differences.\n\nWe started this extreme street food tour in Baku by going to one of the oldest Soviet style cafes for a quick piroshky on the go. It was pretty oily, but pretty tasty especially when drenched in tomato sauce.\n\nAmin Kabab - Next stop on this food tour, we went to Amin Kabab, a small neighborhood kebab grill for a quick Lyulya kebab, or chopped meat kebab.\n\nEskulap Restoran - If you\u2019re looking for one of the best local Azerbaijan kebab meat restaurants in Baku, this is the spot. Adnan explained it\u2019s a legendary restaurant he\u2019s been coming to since he was a kid. They specialize in all things lamb, and along with a variety of stews and braised dishes, one of their specialties is the Khan Kebab, lamb liver wrapped in caul fat and grilled. I also loved the lamb braised in sour plums and barberries and the insane dessert kebab of ground walnuts and lamb fat.

It\u2019s a small and manageable market to get a feeling for the ingredients that go into Senegalese food. At lunchtime just outside the market you\u2019ll find a series of street food stalls that set up serving home cooked Senegalese food. You\u2019ll find dishes like Thieboudienne (jollof rice), okra stew, sweet potato leave, mutton curry, and much more. The food is sensational, so much delicious flavors and huge plates of food. I love the \u201cguana\u201d local chili peppers that taste similar to scotch bonnet chilies. \n \nAfrican Renaissance Monument - We then toured the African Renaissance Monument, one of the icons of Senegal and Africa, to symbolize the rebuilding of Africa after colonization, and to never forget the past slavery trade.\n\nLa Maree Chez Adji (https://goo.gl/maps/ryFnWbyFaHmx5kgd9) - Next up on this ultimate street food tour in Senegal we went to the very Western tip of Africa and restaurant called La Maree Chez Adji to eat fresh lobster and sea urchins.\n\nDibiterie Le Mbot\u00e9 1 (https://goo.gl/maps/8JGNYQfV5vwZBRoDA) - Finally to finish this day we couldn\u2019t miss a dibiterie, Senegal\u2019s take on grilled lamb.

They are known for being a fishing village and for Fadiouth, which is an entire island made from seashells built upon each other. The village is home to both Christians and Muslims living in harmony. Today we\u2019re eating a couple of local meals, including a massively spicy pepper fish soup and exploring the amazing culture of this island.\n\nLa Taverne du P\u00eacheur (https://goo.gl/maps/Qmw2AdicnPje8osx7) - We\u2019re starting the day at La Taverne du P\u00eacheur, a restaurant at the base of the island, just before you cross over the bridge. The restaurant is known for its food and you can order local seafood and local dishes like millet couscous with a variety of seafood. We were able to see the entire cooking process, making fish stew and a bunch of side dishes. I love the use of chilies, garlic, onions, and lime juice within almost all the recipes.\n\nNext up we took a walk around Fadiouth Island, again an island built from a mountain of seashells. The island is walking only and you get there by crossing a bridge or taking a boat. We walked around the island, learning about their unique cultural identity and especially how both Christians and Muslims live together in harmony.\n\nWe then stopped for an afternoon snack, and a dish called fish pepper soup. This Senegalese food is simple, yet shockingly tasty. When I took my first bite, I almost couldn\u2019t believe how much pepper there was - so good - shockingly good!\n\nThank you to Pape Tatandiaye (Visit Senegal https://www.instagram.com/papetatandiaye/)\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US and Canada.

They are known for being a fishing village and for Fadiouth, which is an entire island made from seashells built upon each other. The village is home to both Christians and Muslims living in harmony. Today we\u2019re eating a couple of local meals, including a massively spicy pepper fish soup and exploring the amazing culture of this island.\n\nLa Taverne du P\u00eacheur (https://goo.gl/maps/Qmw2AdicnPje8osx7) - We\u2019re starting the day at La Taverne du P\u00eacheur, a restaurant at the base of the island, just before you cross over the bridge. The restaurant is known for its food and you can order local seafood and local dishes like millet couscous with a variety of seafood. We were able to see the entire cooking process, making fish stew and a bunch of side dishes. I love the use of chilies, garlic, onions, and lime juice within almost all the recipes.\n\nNext up we took a walk around Fadiouth Island, again an island built from a mountain of seashells. The island is walking only and you get there by crossing a bridge or taking a boat. We walked around the island, learning about their unique cultural identity and especially how both Christians and Muslims live together in harmony.\n\nWe then stopped for an afternoon snack, and a dish called fish pepper soup. This Senegalese food is simple, yet shockingly tasty. When I took my first bite, I almost couldn\u2019t believe how much pepper there was - so good - shockingly good!\n\nThank you to Pape Tatandiaye (Visit Senegal https://www.instagram.com/papetatandiaye/)\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US and Canada.

They specialize in Spanish food and particularly roast suckling pig, which they\u2019ve been serving ever since they opened. What\u2019s also amazing is that their stone oven fire is never extinguished, it\u2019s been flaming and never gone out ever since they\u2019ve been open.\n\nWe started off our meal with a few sides and beginning dishes, some baby eels - a delicacy in Spain in olive oil, garlic, and a few dried chilies. They were excellent, although very expensive. Next we had a few vegetable based dishes, some beans with jamon and mushrooms topped with olive oil and garlic. After that I had a chance to see in the horno or the oven room the preparation of the suckling pig. It\u2019s roasted for approximately 2 hours, basted with a sauce to increase the crispiness of the skin. The suckling pig is served in a massive clay boat sized tray and typically served onto your own individual plate. The suckling pig is delicious, and I especially enjoyed all that meat broth at the bottom of the pan.\n\nFinally for dessert we had a milk cake and the highlight was a Spanish cheesecake.\n\nAlthough Sobrino de Bot\u00edn or Restaurant Bot\u00edn, being the oldest restaurant in the world is a tourist attraction, they have maintained the quality of their food and I think it was well worth a visit, especially for any food lover, it\u2019s truly a landmark pilgrimage destination.\n\nTotal price - \u20ac543.89 ($552.46) for 4 adults.

Jose Gordon's family raises their own oxen, much longer than typical commercial beef, and ages the meat to perfection. Sitting in an ancient cave wine cellars you will taste the best steak in the world!\n\nFriends in the video: \nJeffrey Merrihue (https://www.instagram.com/xtremefoodies_/ Thank you to Jeffrey for setting up this once in a lifetime experience)\nKevin Chan (https://www.instagram.com/finediningexp/)\n\nWe arrived in Le\u00f3n about mid morning ready to spend an entire day at Bodega El Capricho, learning about the world\u2019s best beef. Jose Gordon first brought us around the farm, taking us to a variety of places where he raises a number of different breeds of oxen. They were no doubt the biggest cattle I\u2019ve ever seen, giant and healthy, so beautiful - so gentle and yet so powerful. One ox he showed us was over 1600 kilos, literally the size of a rhinoceros.\n\nNext it was the tour of the processing facility where the meat is packaged and shipped. Seeing the best quality beef in the world all in one facility was amazing. What was also a highlight was tasting cecina, Jose\u2019s signature beef which is salted and preserved in a cave for 4 years. The flavor was so intense and so delicious I almost couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nFinally we headed back to the restaurant for the full beef meal which was the full tasting menu. We started off slow and steady and progressed our way to the main event, the giant t-bone ox steak, aged for 180 days and grilled to absolute perfection. The meat was unlike any other steak I\u2019ve ever had, the most intense beefy cheesy flavor I\u2019ve ever had. Truly as Keven mentioned, every other steak will be flavorless after this one. Eating steak in a cave is one of the most memorable food experiences and Spanish food experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nWhat I loved about Jose Gordon is that throughout the process he truly treats his cows and oxen with respect. There\u2019s no doubt you will find some of the best meat on earth at Bodega El Capricho.\n\nBodega El Capricho (https://g.page/BodegaElCapricho?share)\nPrice - 180 Euros per person\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Jose Gordon's family raises their own oxen, much longer than typical commercial beef, and ages the meat to perfection. Sitting in an ancient cave wine cellars you will taste the best steak in the world!\n\nFriends in the video: \nJeffrey Merrihue (https://www.instagram.com/xtremefoodies_/ Thank you to Jeffrey for setting up this once in a lifetime experience)\nKevin Chan (https://www.instagram.com/finediningexp/)\n\nWe arrived in Le\u00f3n about mid morning ready to spend an entire day at Bodega El Capricho, learning about the world\u2019s best beef. Jose Gordon first brought us around the farm, taking us to a variety of places where he raises a number of different breeds of oxen. They were no doubt the biggest cattle I\u2019ve ever seen, giant and healthy, so beautiful - so gentle and yet so powerful. One ox he showed us was over 1600 kilos, literally the size of a rhinoceros.\n\nNext it was the tour of the processing facility where the meat is packaged and shipped. Seeing the best quality beef in the world all in one facility was amazing. What was also a highlight was tasting cecina, Jose\u2019s signature beef which is salted and preserved in a cave for 4 years. The flavor was so intense and so delicious I almost couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nFinally we headed back to the restaurant for the full beef meal which was the full tasting menu. We started off slow and steady and progressed our way to the main event, the giant t-bone ox steak, aged for 180 days and grilled to absolute perfection. The meat was unlike any other steak I\u2019ve ever had, the most intense beefy cheesy flavor I\u2019ve ever had. Truly as Keven mentioned, every other steak will be flavorless after this one. Eating steak in a cave is one of the most memorable food experiences and Spanish food experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nWhat I loved about Jose Gordon is that throughout the process he truly treats his cows and oxen with respect. There\u2019s no doubt you will find some of the best meat on earth at Bodega El Capricho.\n\nBodega El Capricho (https://g.page/BodegaElCapricho?share)\nPrice - 180 Euros per person\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Today is Day 1 in Bangladesh, hanging out with Rasif and Ipsha ( @PetukCouple  ). We\u2019re first eating a huge Bangla home cooked meal at home before trying some local neighborhood street food.

Everything from beef curry to eggplant with egg, moringha drumsticks, fish curry and duck curry. The abundance and variety was outstanding and it was my first ever Bengali meal in Bangladesh!\n\nNext up on this Bangladeshi food tour we walked out on the streets in their Dhaka neighborhood to eat some local street food snacks. We started with an amazing liver jhalmuri (30 BDT ($.035). Jhal means spicy and muri means puffed rice, and this is one of the most popular and common Bengali street food snacks. Especially with the liver, green chilies, and mustard oil, it was fantastic.\n\nContinuing on the street food tour we ate some deep fried fast food like chicken rolls and Bangladeshi chicken nuggets. Then on to a stall that served amazing bhel puri and chotpoti - an incredible mix of chickpeas and spices, green chilies, onions, coriander, and tamarind sauce. The street was so tasty and without a doubt the bhel  puri (20 BDT ($0.23 each) was my favorite snack of the night.\n\nFinally to complete this Day 1 Bangladesh food tour we drove outside of Dhaka about an hour to Mawa Ghat, a famous location along the Padma River to take a ferry, and to eat the national fish of Bangladesh - hilsa (ilish). You choose your fish, we chose three, plus some extra fresh water prawns. The fish is cleaned and sliced in front of you, then marinated in turmeric and chili before being shallow fried in fragrant mustard oil. Additionally with the fried fish tails they smash them with onions and chilies and mustard oil to make Bhorta / Vorta - which is a common Bangla food preparation of ingredients that are smashed together to bring out their flavors. We had two types of fish vortas, an onion vorta, and a tomato vorta.

Today I\u2019m taking you on an ultimate BBQ tour of Eastern North Carolina which is famous for whole hog barbecue!\n\nDuring this food tour we\u2019re going to 5 of the best restaurants in North Carolina, for Eastern style bbq.\n\nThe Skylight Inn, Ayden, North Carolina (https://goo.gl/maps/Wj3t9yRDw464Edmp7) - First stop is The Skylight Inn, easily one of the most well known bbq restaurants in North Carolina, in the United States. They do things the right way, whole hog, slow cooked over smoking coals. One of the best things about The Skylight Inn is when the whole hogs are ready they chop them up, with a ratio of meat, fat, and crispy skin, into an insanely juicy chopped bbq tray. It\u2019s truly a life-changing bbq experience.\n\nBum's Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/yfWPbidoykXLAtGe8) - Just down the road from The Skylight Inn you\u2019ll find Bum's Restaurant, another long time bbq restaurant. Along with whole hog bbq, they also have plenty of other southern US foods and great sides. They do their bbq quite differently, instead of being chopped its much more shredded.\n\nB's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/AgiGLpQPSwhdWDgb7) - Greenville, North Carolina - Next we drove out to B's Barbecue, a local favorite. I had really wanted to try the chicken bbq, but unfortunately they had already sold out. We barely made it in time to get some whole hog, but luckily we did. It was delicious and so were all the sides.\n\nGrady's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/1tTj9qgL2guawpK48) Dudley, North Carolina - Another amazing and one of the best bbq restaurants to try in North Carolina is in the small town of Dudley. Again, they do things the right way, slow cooked over coals, the entire pig. Along with the pork, their other dishes, including smoked turkey and bbq chicken, and all the sides were outstanding.\n\nWilber's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/6SKdDphpu1mEhcUH6) Goldsboro, North Carolina - Finally to complete this North Carolina bbq tour, we\u2019re eating at Wilber's Barbecue which is a fantastic family restaurant. Their food and service is fantastic. Also, one bonus about the bbq here is that you can order the leftover or picnic bbq ribs, which are delicious and fun to eat.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in North Carolina, BBQ is something you must eat, it\u2019s a huge part of the local culture, and I hope you can try some of these best Barbecue restaurants!\n\n \ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

                        "description": "\ud83c\udfa5 New Orleans Food Tour: https://youtu.be/-n0lKyrSJB4\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe Don\u2019t miss new food videos!\n\nNORTH CAROLINA, USA - Welcome to North Carolina, one of the capitals of Barbecue, in the world. Today I\u2019m taking you on an ultimate BBQ tour of Eastern North Carolina which is famous for whole hog barbecue!\n\nDuring this food tour we\u2019re going to 5 of the best restaurants in North Carolina, for Eastern style bbq.\n\nThe Skylight Inn, Ayden, North Carolina (https://goo.gl/maps/Wj3t9yRDw464Edmp7) - First stop is The Skylight Inn, easily one of the most well known bbq restaurants in North Carolina, in the United States. They do things the right way, whole hog, slow cooked over smoking coals. One of the best things about The Skylight Inn is when the whole hogs are ready they chop them up, with a ratio of meat, fat, and crispy skin, into an insanely juicy chopped bbq tray. It\u2019s truly a life-changing bbq experience.\n\nBum's Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/yfWPbidoykXLAtGe8) - Just down the road from The Skylight Inn you\u2019ll find Bum's Restaurant, another long time bbq restaurant. Along with whole hog bbq, they also have plenty of other southern US foods and great sides. They do their bbq quite differently, instead of being chopped its much more shredded.\n\nB's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/AgiGLpQPSwhdWDgb7) - Greenville, North Carolina - Next we drove out to B's Barbecue, a local favorite. I had really wanted to try the chicken bbq, but unfortunately they had already sold out. We barely made it in time to get some whole hog, but luckily we did. It was delicious and so were all the sides.\n\nGrady's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/1tTj9qgL2guawpK48) Dudley, North Carolina - Another amazing and one of the best bbq restaurants to try in North Carolina is in the small town of Dudley. Again, they do things the right way, slow cooked over coals, the entire pig. Along with the pork, their other dishes, including smoked turkey and bbq chicken, and all the sides were outstanding.\n\nWilber's Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/6SKdDphpu1mEhcUH6) Goldsboro, North Carolina - Finally to complete this North Carolina bbq tour, we\u2019re eating at Wilber's Barbecue which is a fantastic family restaurant. Their food and service is fantastic. Also, one bonus about the bbq here is that you can order the leftover or picnic bbq ribs, which are delicious and fun to eat.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in North Carolina, BBQ is something you must eat, it\u2019s a huge part of the local culture, and I hope you can try some of these best Barbecue restaurants!\n\n \ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It\u2019s one of the most beautiful cities in the US and it has a rich history of food. Today, we\u2019re going on a classic, heritage food tour of San Francisco, where we\u2019re going to eat at some of the oldest and best restaurants in the city.

It\u2019s like taking a step back in time from the moment you step in. It\u2019s all seafood bar counter style, fresh, and whatever is in season. I tried a bunch of different dishes, including a Crab Louie (another dish invented in San Francisco), plus smoked salmon on sourdough, chowder, shrimp cocktail, Sicilian sashimi, and crab backs. What a meal and what a way to start off this ultimate San Francisco food tour.\n\nSotto Mare (https://goo.gl/maps/ZKvJcnWGzYYMqYFG6) - Next we headed over to Sotto Mare, an Italian American restaurant serving seafood and local dishes. Among their list of dishes, no one goes to Sotto Mare without ordering their cioppino, an Italian American seafood medley with tomatoes and white wine and plenty of garlic. It\u2019s the signature dish of San Francisco, and you can\u2019t visit without trying it.\n\nAnchor Oyster Bar (https://goo.gl/maps/11JCpCf8g8rv6kJt6) - Total price - $136.29 - One of my personal favorite restaurants in San Francisco is Anchor Oyster Bar, where they again specialize in both oysters and cioppino. I ordered a nice tray of oysters to begin with, and finished with a huge bowl of cioppino. To me, this is the gold standard - a beautiful tomato broth that\u2019s not too heavy and not too light, accented with herbs and spices, and a huge variety of seafood. An amazing meal.\n\nTadich Grill (https://g.page/TadichGrill?share) - Total price - $129.26 - Finally to complete this San Francisco food tour we headed to Tadich Grill in downtown. Dating back to 1849, it\u2019s not only the oldest restaurant in SF, but the oldest restaurant in California! It\u2019s absolutely classic from the moment you walk in, huge wooden bar counter, high saloon style ceiling, and waiters in white coats. I tried a number of dishes including, you guessed it - cioppino.

Today we have the special opportunity to go on the Wine Train, a historical railroad journey that's been restored as a gourmet food experience. I\u2019m going to share with you a little behind the scenes of what goes into the Wine Train, and all the delicious food on board!\n\nAgain, thank you to Visit California (and Visit Napa Valley) for sponsoring my trip.\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/visitcalifornia/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VisitCalifornia \n\nWe arrived early and headed to the commissary to learn a little about what happens behind the scenes of the Wine Train. It was also a great opportunity to learn a little about the history of the Wine Train and how it was established and later restored, and converted into a gourmet meal experience and what it is today. We saw a little of the prep in the kitchen and then some of the chef\u2019s loading their ingredients onto the train for the lunch ride.\n\nWhen the time came, we boarded the train, and first sat in the lounge to enjoy a drink and appetizer. For appetizers today we had a tray of cheeses and fruits. After the train traveled from Napa to St. Helena, it then turns around and heads back. We then headed over to the main dining car for lunch. In the kitchen things were buzzing - unlike a restaurant where guests arrived staggered, on the wine train, everyone is there and ready to eat at the same time. So the kitchen car is a frenzy at peak time. Yet as soon as all the orders are ready, it\u2019s immediately calm. It was quite unique to see. For lunch we tried the tenderloin and the herb roasted chicken.\n\nDefinitely the Wine Train is not only about the food, but really about the atmosphere, the classic heritage of the train cars and decorations, and the gorgeous changing scenery of Napa Valley. I thought it was an incredible experience in California.\n\nWe took the Gourmet Express train for lunch and depending on season and situation, prices can fluctuate between $265 - $325 per person. \ud83d\ude82 Wine Train: https://www.winetrain.com/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

                    "description": "NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: Welcome to New Orleans, one of the most exciting cities in the United States and one of the most delicious. Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate food tour of the old French Quarter of New Orleans. We\u2019ll be eating a lot of delicious and legendary food, and I\u2019m going to share everything with you in this video now.\n\nThanks to Derek Robinson, my brother in law for featuring in this video. He roasts amazing coffee: https://www.instagram.com/dereksips/\n\nHere are the places we went:\n\nCafe Du Monde French Market (https://goo.gl/maps/CMpWpkiHZ6Htsjdf8) - Easily the most recognizable and iconic coffee shops in New Orleans, and probably the United States, Cafe Du Monde serves unique chicory coffee and beignet. Although seemingly always packed, it\u2019s a great place to get your day started when you\u2019re in the French Quarter.\n\nCentral Grocery and Deli (https://goo.gl/maps/rawmkK8vuhkqGKcNA) Price - $22.60 - Next up we walked down the road to Central Grocery and Deli, home of the original muffuletta, a gigantic round sandwich with a variety of meats and cheeses, but most importantly an olive salad. The olives are what totally set it apart.\n\nCoop's Place (https://goo.gl/maps/5BBbNZSjKA9syZez7) - Price - $29 - Unfortunately Coop\u2019s Place is only over 21, and they don\u2019t allow filming inside. So we took our rabbit sausage jambalaya and \u00e9touff\u00e9e to go. Both dishes were delicious, especially the jambalaya!\n\nVerti Marte (https://goo.gl/maps/aXaWVqeiBxn2Nck3A) - All That Jazz Po' boy - $14.68 - Next up on this ultimate food tour in New Orleans, we stopped at Verti Marte for a giant Po\u2019boy that included just about everything you could possibly imagine. It was a heavy sandwich but totally worth it.\n\nGalatoire's (https://goo.gl/maps/nL31RS5kNsYKxnzX6) - Price - $40 - $60 per person - Next up for dinner, I made a reservation at Galatoire's, known to be one of the best restaurants in New Orleans. Although they didn\u2019t invent Oysters Rockefeller, they make a great version of them, and for me that was one of the highlights. Also, don\u2019t miss the flaming coffee to finish your meal!\n\nBrennan's (https://g.page/BrennansNewOrleans?share) - Price - $22.04 - Finally completely unplanned, because we were right around the corner, we headed to Brennan's where they invented Bananas Foster! As Derek said, the best bananas foster he\u2019s ever had.\n\nAnd that wraps up this ultimate food tour in the New Orleans French Quarter. It was an amazing day exploring Creole and Cajun cuisine and culture in New Orleans!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

                        "description": "NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: Welcome to New Orleans, one of the most exciting cities in the United States and one of the most delicious. Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate food tour of the old French Quarter of New Orleans. We\u2019ll be eating a lot of delicious and legendary food, and I\u2019m going to share everything with you in this video now.\n\nThanks to Derek Robinson, my brother in law for featuring in this video. He roasts amazing coffee: https://www.instagram.com/dereksips/\n\nHere are the places we went:\n\nCafe Du Monde French Market (https://goo.gl/maps/CMpWpkiHZ6Htsjdf8) - Easily the most recognizable and iconic coffee shops in New Orleans, and probably the United States, Cafe Du Monde serves unique chicory coffee and beignet. Although seemingly always packed, it\u2019s a great place to get your day started when you\u2019re in the French Quarter.\n\nCentral Grocery and Deli (https://goo.gl/maps/rawmkK8vuhkqGKcNA) Price - $22.60 - Next up we walked down the road to Central Grocery and Deli, home of the original muffuletta, a gigantic round sandwich with a variety of meats and cheeses, but most importantly an olive salad. The olives are what totally set it apart.\n\nCoop's Place (https://goo.gl/maps/5BBbNZSjKA9syZez7) - Price - $29 - Unfortunately Coop\u2019s Place is only over 21, and they don\u2019t allow filming inside. So we took our rabbit sausage jambalaya and \u00e9touff\u00e9e to go. Both dishes were delicious, especially the jambalaya!\n\nVerti Marte (https://goo.gl/maps/aXaWVqeiBxn2Nck3A) - All That Jazz Po' boy - $14.68 - Next up on this ultimate food tour in New Orleans, we stopped at Verti Marte for a giant Po\u2019boy that included just about everything you could possibly imagine. It was a heavy sandwich but totally worth it.\n\nGalatoire's (https://goo.gl/maps/nL31RS5kNsYKxnzX6) - Price - $40 - $60 per person - Next up for dinner, I made a reservation at Galatoire's, known to be one of the best restaurants in New Orleans. Although they didn\u2019t invent Oysters Rockefeller, they make a great version of them, and for me that was one of the highlights. Also, don\u2019t miss the flaming coffee to finish your meal!\n\nBrennan's (https://g.page/BrennansNewOrleans?share) - Price - $22.04 - Finally completely unplanned, because we were right around the corner, we headed to Brennan's where they invented Bananas Foster! As Derek said, the best bananas foster he\u2019s ever had.\n\nAnd that wraps up this ultimate food tour in the New Orleans French Quarter. It was an amazing day exploring Creole and Cajun cuisine and culture in New Orleans!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Instead, it was a barbershop, salon, and a bar. With the bar customers came a demand for food, and soon their food became famous - so well known that the food took over and it was turned into a restaurant. In 2005, Ms. Willie Mae Seaton was awarded with a James Beard award for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Classic Restaurant for the Southern Region.\u201d This prestigious award opened new doors and really put Willie Mae\u2019s Scotch House on the map across the United States. Ms. Willie Mae Seaton has since passed away, but her legacy of delicious food and caring for the community will never be forgotten.\n\nI ordered a number of fried chicken plates all coming with different sides. Let me first tell you about the fried chicken - battered and deep fried. But the batter didn't feel too heavy or caky, and what I liked the most is that when you bite down, the entire skin crispiness doesn\u2019t all come of, but rather stays on the chicken. The chicken was so moist and juicy and the flavor was salty with a hint of spice. Willie Mae\u2019s Scotch House has been named the best fried chicken in America, and I\u2019m not going to argue!\n\nThe sides were also delicious, I loved the beans and rice, the green beans and the fried okra.

During our trip to New England we were not going to miss this opportunity to eat the king of deep fried seafood, and we got a gigantic $284.75 Fisherman\u2019s Platter!\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!\n\nWoodman's of Essex (https://g.page/woodmansofessex?share) Total price - $284.75 - We arrived to Woodman's of Essex, ready to devour some deep fried seafood. As the true story goes, back in 1916 Lawrence \"Chubby\" Woodman and his wife Bessie had a cart and sold fresh clams and deep fried potato chips. One day one of his fisherman friends told him to deep fry some clams in the potato chip oil. It was almost a joke - they said it was something humorous, but after trying it, they realized they might be onto something. They invented and popularized the fried clam. To this day, the original fried clam is available at Woodman's of Essex and it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nAt Woodman\u2019s they also have a host of other deep fried seafood, including clam strips, scallops, shrimp, and fish, plus onion rings and fries.

During our trip to New England we were not going to miss this opportunity to eat the king of deep fried seafood, and we got a gigantic $284.75 Fisherman\u2019s Platter!\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!\n\nWoodman's of Essex (https://g.page/woodmansofessex?share) Total price - $284.75 - We arrived to Woodman's of Essex, ready to devour some deep fried seafood. As the true story goes, back in 1916 Lawrence \"Chubby\" Woodman and his wife Bessie had a cart and sold fresh clams and deep fried potato chips. One day one of his fisherman friends told him to deep fry some clams in the potato chip oil. It was almost a joke - they said it was something humorous, but after trying it, they realized they might be onto something. They invented and popularized the fried clam. To this day, the original fried clam is available at Woodman's of Essex and it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nAt Woodman\u2019s they also have a host of other deep fried seafood, including clam strips, scallops, shrimp, and fish, plus onion rings and fries. We decided to order a huge fisherman\u2019s platter, including a mix of everything piled high onto Jeffrey\u2019s lobster tray.\n\nWhile all the seafood at Woodman's of Essex is delicious and remarkably deep fried and crispy, still nothing beats the deep fried clams - the original deep fried clams.\n\nKelly's Roast Beef (https://goo.gl/maps/9fiUWiJMWFYnz4Y98) Price - $14.02 meal combo - next up on this mini tour, just down the Massachusetts coast I stopped at Kelly's Roast Beef, legendary for their roast beef sandwich.

Philly is known for many things and it\u2019s an American food paradise. Today, we\u2019re going on an ultimate Philadelphia food tour - we\u2019ll be eating everything from Italian hoagies to cheese steaks to tomato pizzas - and hanging out with the amazing @JLJupiterTV . Let\u2019s start eating!\n\nRicci's Hoagies (https://goo.gl/maps/caxWt8i86LRMP7zj7) - Old Fashioned Italian - $10.50 - Ricci's Hoagies has been serving hoagies, the Philadelphia name for a sub sandwich, since 1920. One of the things that immediately stands out is how they slice your meat directly onto your sandwich. The meat never gets crusty and that makes a huge difference. One of the best deli sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nCacia's Bakery (https://goo.gl/maps/ijVwir6w8eGg4j8M6) - Another iconic food that Philadelphia is known for is tomato pie pizzas. The tomato sauce is known as gravy, and at Cacia's Bakery the gravy is made by hand, loaded with parmesan cheese, and baked onto a pizza base. The result is refreshing and focused on the amazing tomato sauce. They also have pizzas with cheese which are also delicious.\n\nJohn's Roast Pork (https://goo.gl/maps/R5gBRMVpAV6A2XD29) - Roast pork - $10.75, Cheese Steak - $12.00 - Next JL and I went to John's Roast Pork, one of the Philly food legends, known for both roast pork sandwiches and Philly cheese steak. We got one of each. The pork sandwich was incredible, so juicy and peppery. And the cheese steak, was without a doubt one of the best cheese steaks I ate in Philadelphia (and we went on a full cheese steak tour, another video). Both absolutely sensational sandwiches in Philadelphia!\n\nSister Muhammad's Kitchen (https://goo.gl/maps/Eb8mVSZ5L6CpuvUh7) - Fish Hoagie - $10.50 - Next up on this ultimate food tour in Philadelphia we headed to Sister Muhammad's Kitchen to try their fish hoagies. They marinate the fish, batter it and deep fry it, and you\u2019re guaranteed freshly fried fish in anything you order. We had their amazing fried fish hoagie, plus a Muslim fish hoagie which included a few extra ingredients and sauces, and finally, fried fish fried rice. Another amazing spot in Philly.\n\nJohn's Water Ice (https://goo.gl/maps/Bj2rk8jjgz5X435N9) - Lemon water ice - $2.00 - Finally to finish this food tour we stopped in South Philly for a legendary water ice. Very refreshing on a summer afternoon.\n\nWhat an amazing day in Philadelphia - cool people and delicious food.

Easily the most famous food in all of Philadelphia, and one of the most famous foods in the United States is the Philly cheesesteak or spelled cheese steak. Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate Philly cheesesteak tour - we\u2019re going to eat 5 different cheesesteaks in Philadelphia! #Philly #cheesesteak #Philadelphia\n\nPat's King of Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/Atz65Afjh6PKKGGr7) - Cheesesteak - $12 - First, Pat's King of Steaks, where it all started. At first it didn\u2019t include cheese, so it was just a steak sandwich. At Pat\u2019s the steak is frizzled, and they generously add cheese whiz. Even though locals say Pat\u2019s is a tourist trap, they deserve credit for being the original and starting it all. I would say it was a fantastic experience, and even just being there eating a cheesesteak there on the corner with its history was cool. And their cheese fries were amazing.\n\nGeno's Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/HJ3Vp9nLKMLxBytz6) - Mushroom cheesesteak - $12 - Next up, when you eat at Pat\u2019s, there\u2019s no way you can\u2019t walk across the intersection to Geno's Steaks, known for its giant logo and bright lights. Their steak is unchopped, just thin slices, but it\u2019s nice and tender. We actually tried a mushroom provolone cheese steak here. Overall, it was pretty pure, not the best, but not bad.\n\nL & M Variety Store (https://goo.gl/maps/VYm3ukTixUt7CxGt7) - Cheesesteak - $5 - Next up for one of the common local stops to eat a Philly cheesesteak, a corner convenience store. For $5 in Philadelphia, it doesn\u2019t get much better. As JL mentioned, one of the best things about a corner store is that you often know the owners and can customize it how you like it.\n\nDalessandro's Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/Lj2dpKzYfHTDJUCi6) - Cheesesteak - $11 - Another local famous popular is Dalessandro's Steaks, and they have a line to show. We ordered their classic cheesesteak, with cheese whiz and onions. Overall, it was good, but the steak was a little overly shredded to the point of almost being minced meat.\n\nJim's South St. (https://g.page/JimsSouthSt?share) - Cheesesteak - $10.25 - Lastly to complete this cheesesteak tour of Philadelphia, we went to Jim's South St. I think this was the cheese steak that surprised both JL and I, and to be honest it was probably the best of the day. The steak was tender, the bread was soft and fluffy, and the whiz was perfectly layered on the bottom and top with plenty of grilled onions.\n\nAdditionally, though not in this video, we had 2 other cheesesteaks in Philadelphia, which were to be honest, probably the best 2 I had in Philadelphia: John's Roast Pork (https://youtu.be/EZozuJQZ7Q0) and Angelo's Pizzeria (video coming)\n\nAgain, go check out JL\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/planetaryp\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

                        "description": "\ud83d\udd39Check out JL\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/planetaryp\n\ud83e\udd56Philly Food Tour: https://youtu.be/EZozuJQZ7Q0\n\ud83d\udd14SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe Don\u2019t miss new food videos!\n\nPHILADELPHIA, USA - Welcome to Philadelphia! Easily the most famous food in all of Philadelphia, and one of the most famous foods in the United States is the Philly cheesesteak or spelled cheese steak. Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate Philly cheesesteak tour - we\u2019re going to eat 5 different cheesesteaks in Philadelphia! #Philly #cheesesteak #Philadelphia\n\nPat's King of Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/Atz65Afjh6PKKGGr7) - Cheesesteak - $12 - First, Pat's King of Steaks, where it all started. At first it didn\u2019t include cheese, so it was just a steak sandwich. At Pat\u2019s the steak is frizzled, and they generously add cheese whiz. Even though locals say Pat\u2019s is a tourist trap, they deserve credit for being the original and starting it all. I would say it was a fantastic experience, and even just being there eating a cheesesteak there on the corner with its history was cool. And their cheese fries were amazing.\n\nGeno's Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/HJ3Vp9nLKMLxBytz6) - Mushroom cheesesteak - $12 - Next up, when you eat at Pat\u2019s, there\u2019s no way you can\u2019t walk across the intersection to Geno's Steaks, known for its giant logo and bright lights. Their steak is unchopped, just thin slices, but it\u2019s nice and tender. We actually tried a mushroom provolone cheese steak here. Overall, it was pretty pure, not the best, but not bad.\n\nL & M Variety Store (https://goo.gl/maps/VYm3ukTixUt7CxGt7) - Cheesesteak - $5 - Next up for one of the common local stops to eat a Philly cheesesteak, a corner convenience store. For $5 in Philadelphia, it doesn\u2019t get much better. As JL mentioned, one of the best things about a corner store is that you often know the owners and can customize it how you like it.\n\nDalessandro's Steaks (https://goo.gl/maps/Lj2dpKzYfHTDJUCi6) - Cheesesteak - $11 - Another local famous popular is Dalessandro's Steaks, and they have a line to show. We ordered their classic cheesesteak, with cheese whiz and onions. Overall, it was good, but the steak was a little overly shredded to the point of almost being minced meat.\n\nJim's South St. (https://g.page/JimsSouthSt?share) - Cheesesteak - $10.25 - Lastly to complete this cheesesteak tour of Philadelphia, we went to Jim's South St. I think this was the cheese steak that surprised both JL and I, and to be honest it was probably the best of the day. The steak was tender, the bread was soft and fluffy, and the whiz was perfectly layered on the bottom and top with plenty of grilled onions.\n\nAdditionally, though not in this video, we had 2 other cheesesteaks in Philadelphia, which were to be honest, probably the best 2 I had in Philadelphia: John's Roast Pork (https://youtu.be/EZozuJQZ7Q0) and Angelo's Pizzeria (video coming)\n\nAgain, go check out JL\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/planetaryp\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Along with the crust, New Haven is known for its white clam pie, a pizza that was invented at Frank Pepe, but you\u2019ll now find at pizzerias throughout New Haven. I can safely say that New Haven pizza is the best pizza I\u2019ve ever had in my life.

We all agreed their white clam pie is the best in New Haven.\nPrice - About $17 per medium pizza\n\nFrank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (https://g.page/FrankPepesNewHaven?share) - Frank Pepe is the ultimate legend of New Haven pizza, the epicenter, and where it all began in 1925. They invented the white clam pie, and their pizzas are very thin and very crispy. The char, their massive 14 foot coal burning overs, and the caramelised toppings, are truly remarkable. A life changing pizza experience with so much history.\nPrice - About $25 per medium pizza\n\nModern Apizza (https://goo.gl/maps/CRFkvXdzA9ZmQmta8) - Lastly, I had a chance to try Modern Apizza, another local favorite New Haven pizzeria. Again, they have a very thin crust and a distinct char. Their white clam pie was heavier on the mozzarella cheese than the others, but delicious. However, I preferred their sausage pizza which was outstanding.\nPrice - About $18 per medium pizza\n\nAll three pizza places were fantastic and you should try all of them on your pizza tour of New Haven, Connecticut. I can tell you without a doubt, I\u2019m a fan of New Haven Apizza for life!! Best pizza in America?

This is the first part of the ultimate lobster and lobster roll tour of Maine! I can\u2019t wait to share all the amazing lobsters, the juicy lobster rolls, and the amazing scenery of Maine with you.\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jessica: https://www.instagram.com/cheatdayeats/\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jeffrey: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!\n\nIn this first video of lobster roll eating in Maine, we went to 4 different places along the coast, a few amazing lobster shacks, and a few lobster pounds - which is the term used for waterfront shacks that have live lobsters.\n\nFive Islands Lobster Co - $19.95 per normal roll (we got the Big Boy for $44 per lobster roll) (https://goo.gl/maps/EFnXaMSmWMkyynsW8) - Welcome to Five Islands Lobster Co, located in a spectacular location overlooking five islands. You can get their lobster rolls and their boiled lobsters, both are excellent choices. You are guaranteed extremely fresh lobsters from local fishermen.\n\nDay's Crabmeat & Lobster - $57.61 for all lobsters (https://goo.gl/maps/suG8EafZ8ahDUrds7) - Next, we go to Day's Crabmeat & Lobster, which is a lobster pound on the highway that has live lobsters. We got there a little too early, so they weren\u2019t yet making lobster rolls, but we made our own. Again, you\u2019re guaranteed fresh lobsters here.\n\nRed's Eats - $32.75 per roll (https://goo.gl/maps/zLpBokuuUZVBPXzk6) - Red's Eats is probably the most famous lobster roll shack in the world, an iconic white and red shack on the corner of the road. Their lobster rolls are known for being huge and overstuffed, which is no joke. Their lobster rolls are legendary and great, but to me they didn\u2019t taste as fresh as the other places. It was huge and fun to eat, but not the best.\n\nMcLoons Lobster Shack - $22.95 per roll (https://goo.gl/maps/7KWtPmr7SJUHAoQe9) - Finally we drove out to McLoons Lobster Shack. First of all, located on an island, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful locations for any lobster shack in Maine. The lobsters are kept in the seawater so again they are guaranteed to be fresh. But the real difference here is that the lobsters are steamed instead of boiled for your lobster roll. Jeffrey and I both agreed, best lobster rolls we\u2019d ever had.\n\nAn amazing day eating Maine lobster, and many more lobsters and lobster rolls to come!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

This is the first part of the ultimate lobster and lobster roll tour of Maine! I can\u2019t wait to share all the amazing lobsters, the juicy lobster rolls, and the amazing scenery of Maine with you.\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jessica: https://www.instagram.com/cheatdayeats/\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jeffrey: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!\n\nIn this first video of lobster roll eating in Maine, we went to 4 different places along the coast, a few amazing lobster shacks, and a few lobster pounds - which is the term used for waterfront shacks that have live lobsters.\n\nFive Islands Lobster Co - $19.95 per normal roll (we got the Big Boy for $44 per lobster roll) (https://goo.gl/maps/EFnXaMSmWMkyynsW8) - Welcome to Five Islands Lobster Co, located in a spectacular location overlooking five islands. You can get their lobster rolls and their boiled lobsters, both are excellent choices. You are guaranteed extremely fresh lobsters from local fishermen.\n\nDay's Crabmeat & Lobster - $57.61 for all lobsters (https://goo.gl/maps/suG8EafZ8ahDUrds7) - Next, we go to Day's Crabmeat & Lobster, which is a lobster pound on the highway that has live lobsters. We got there a little too early, so they weren\u2019t yet making lobster rolls, but we made our own. Again, you\u2019re guaranteed fresh lobsters here.\n\nRed's Eats - $32.75 per roll (https://goo.gl/maps/zLpBokuuUZVBPXzk6) - Red's Eats is probably the most famous lobster roll shack in the world, an iconic white and red shack on the corner of the road. Their lobster rolls are known for being huge and overstuffed, which is no joke. Their lobster rolls are legendary and great, but to me they didn\u2019t taste as fresh as the other places. It was huge and fun to eat, but not the best.\n\nMcLoons Lobster Shack - $22.95 per roll (https://goo.gl/maps/7KWtPmr7SJUHAoQe9) - Finally we drove out to McLoons Lobster Shack. First of all, located on an island, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful locations for any lobster shack in Maine. The lobsters are kept in the seawater so again they are guaranteed to be fresh. But the real difference here is that the lobsters are steamed instead of boiled for your lobster roll. Jeffrey and I both agreed, best lobster rolls we\u2019d ever had.\n\nAn amazing day eating Maine lobster, and many more lobsters and lobster rolls to come!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It\u2019s a method of cooking where a variety of seafood, plus potatoes and corn, are steamed and baked, sometimes underground, topped with local seaweed, over fire. When I was Cabbage Island Clambakes, I knew it was going to be epic!\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jeffrey: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!\n\ud83d\udd39 Follow Jessica: https://www.instagram.com/cheatdayeats/\n\nThe journey begins from Booth Bay, a beautiful coastal town in Maine. We set off for Cabbage Island, with about an hour boat ride and tour of the harbor. When we arrived to Cabbage Island, I was excited and ready to see the clambake and eat. One of the great things about this clambake is that it attracts so many people, and therefore they cook such a huge quantity of food at one time - making it it even more of a delicious and visual experience.\n\nThey had two full trays of lobster, 298 lobsters for lunch! Plus an entire tray of corn, potatoes, onions, and eggs. There\u2019s a very interesting story where they used to use the eggs as a timer, when the egg would cook and crack, then the clambake and all the seafood would be ready. I\u2019m happy that even though they don\u2019t need the egg timer anymore, they have maintained the tradition.\n\nThe clambake was incredible, I loved how all the ingredients steamed, baked, and roasted all at the same time. The lobster was probably the best I had in all of Maine. It was perfectly cooked, and some of the sweetest and juiciest lobster I\u2019ve had. That clambake technique is without a doubt one of the best ways to preserve the taste of the fresh Maine lobsters. The clams - or I think in this case they were steamers, were also delicious. The sweet corn was among the best I\u2019ve ever had, and the potato and eggs were great as well. \n\nFinally to finish you meal at Cabbage Island Clambake, you get their famous blueberry cake, which is famous for a reason - one of the best of the best blueberry cakes ever.\n\nAnd that completes the Cabbage Island Clambake experience. Highly recommended when you\u2019re in Maine, and I think it\u2019s one of the greatest USA, American food experiences you can have.\n\nMake reservations here: https://www.cabbageislandclambake.com/\nPrice - It was $72.50 per person\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Today we\u2019re going on an ultimate Mexican street food tour of Tucson, and I can\u2019t wait to share all the food with you today!\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Adam Lehrman: https://tucsonfoodie.com/ (https://www.instagram.com/tucsonfoodie/)\n\ud83d\udd39 Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!\n\ud83d\udd39 Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures  (https://www.instagram.com/mexi_papa_adventures/)\n\nHere are all the street food stalls, trucks, and restaurants we ate at:\n\nTaqueria El Rapido: https://goo.gl/maps/y3f6GN9v2mrnZUhC8 - We started off with Taqueria El Rapido a laid back food truck selling a variety of different tacos. Mexi Papa ordered a combination taco for all of us, including asada, tripa, and cabeza, three wonderful different textures. It was a delicious taco and a great way to begin this food tour.\n\nEl Guero Canelo Restaurant: https://goo.gl/maps/83VH1GQEXy46YTvc8 - Sonoran hot dogs are one of the most popular foods in Tucson, and there are many to choose from. We decided on El Guero Canelo as it\u2019s one of the most legendary, historical, and because this restaurant has even received a James Beard award - an award winning hot dog. It didn\u2019t disappoint, a delicious creation.\n\nRollies Mexican Patio: https://goo.gl/maps/cBLJmU9auogWZ5yu6 - Next up for a modern twist to local Tucson Mexican food - Rollies. We had rolled tacos, flat enchiladas, carne asada fries, birria tacos, and birria ramen. You could taste the quality and amazing flavors. Great laid back spot with delicious Mexican Tucson style food.\n\nCocteleria La Palma Mariscos: https://goo.gl/maps/zqz6hc2Hcb9qah1T9 - When you have the meat sweats, head over to Cocteleria La Palma Mariscos for their ceviche and coctels. The mix of seafood was extremely refreshing and perfect for the hot afternoon in Arizona.

But at Tucson\u2019s Percheron Mexican Grill, they take the percheron to the next level by wrapping it in bacon fully, and searing off the bacon on a hot griddle before you\u2019re served. At first, I was thinking it might be over the top, and just too much of a good thing. But taking my first bite, I knew it wasn\u2019t hype, it\u2019s the real deal. Somehow the bacon isn\u2019t overpowering or even too rich, it just provides the ultimate burrito wrapping. Incredibly tasty, a must when you\u2019re in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Elotes el Fridas (https://goo.gl/maps/8rMKThWMaaurdFDA9) - Price - $5 - Next up on this Mexican street food tour in Tucson, Carlos and I headed over to Elotes el Fridas to eat elotes, corn on the cob dressed in Mexican cream, mayo, and cheese, with self seasoning of salsas.

He is so passionate and knowledgeable about barbecue and I can\u2019t wait for you to meet him in this video. Let\u2019s go eat! #BBQ #Phoenix #Arizona\n\nAs soon as you enter JL Smokehouse you know it\u2019s laid back and unique. JL as he calls himself, is the pitmaster, and knows his bbq. Although he offers brisket, chicken, sausages and an assortment of meats, his southern style bbq pork ribs and pulled pork are the true highlights and something you don\u2019t want to miss. \u201cI have the best pulled pork in the country,\u201d says Lewis, and when you see how the entire pork shoulder melts on the smoker, you know it\u2019s special. Before serving it, they chop it up coarsely and then squeeze on a generous amount of their legendary bbq sauce.\n\nI ordered the slugger combo plate, which included six different bbq meats and a few sides, plus I got an entire rack of pork ribs. JL showed me how he seasons the ribs with his own recipe dry rub, then smokes the ribs bone side down - never ever flipping them over. The pulled pork was indeed the best I\u2019ve had, so smoky, so ultra tender and bursting with flavor when combined with the tangy bbq sauce. JL mentioned that he didn\u2019t like to classify his bbq into any US regions, but did mention that it\u2019s influenced and similar to Memphis style bbq.\n\n\u201cPut Some South in Your Mouth!!\u201d - JL Smokehouse!!\n\nIt was an amazing experience to hang out with JL for a few hours and learn about his process of BBQ and to eat an amazing BBQ meal.

Along with a ton of amazingly delicious food, the chimichanga, which is a deep fried burrito often covered in sauce, was invented at a restaurant called El Charro Cafe! Today we\u2019re going to eat the original chimichanga, filled with carne seca, a spectacular sun dried beef.\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Adam Lehrman: https://tucsonfoodie.com/ (https://www.instagram.com/tucsonfoodie/)\n\ud83d\udd39 Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!\n\ud83d\udd39 Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures  (https://www.instagram.com/mexi_papa_adventures/)\n\nIn 1922, Tia Monica Flin had a wrapped burrito in hand when she accidentally dropped it into the deep fat fryer. After being deep fried, it turned out it was a good thing, and they kept it! I love any accidental deep fry story and the chimichanga is no different. Today, they are known for a number of different things - inventing the original chimichanga, and carne seca, thin slices of beef which sun dry in a hanging cage above the restaurant. The carne seca is dried for two days, then shredded and cooked down with onions, tomatoes, and chilies. It\u2019s then filled into your chimichanga. The combination of deep fried crispy tortilla and the smoky condensed flavor of the carne seca was something truly special.\n\nJeffrey, Mexi Papa, Adam, and I, all agreed that this is a one of a kind restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious. Without a doubt one of the best Mexican American / Tex Mex restaurants I\u2019ve ever been too. That accidental deep fried burrito (a chimichanga) is truly a culinary experience and a gem of Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\ud83d\udccd El Charro Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/Rxm89YvKtk5qTw8k6\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Along with a ton of amazingly delicious food, the chimichanga, which is a deep fried burrito often covered in sauce, was invented at a restaurant called El Charro Cafe! Today we\u2019re going to eat the original chimichanga, filled with carne seca, a spectacular sun dried beef.\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Adam Lehrman: https://tucsonfoodie.com/ (https://www.instagram.com/tucsonfoodie/)\n\ud83d\udd39 Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!\n\ud83d\udd39 Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures  (https://www.instagram.com/mexi_papa_adventures/)\n\nIn 1922, Tia Monica Flin had a wrapped burrito in hand when she accidentally dropped it into the deep fat fryer. After being deep fried, it turned out it was a good thing, and they kept it! I love any accidental deep fry story and the chimichanga is no different. Today, they are known for a number of different things - inventing the original chimichanga, and carne seca, thin slices of beef which sun dry in a hanging cage above the restaurant. The carne seca is dried for two days, then shredded and cooked down with onions, tomatoes, and chilies. It\u2019s then filled into your chimichanga. The combination of deep fried crispy tortilla and the smoky condensed flavor of the carne seca was something truly special.\n\nJeffrey, Mexi Papa, Adam, and I, all agreed that this is a one of a kind restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious. Without a doubt one of the best Mexican American / Tex Mex restaurants I\u2019ve ever been too. That accidental deep fried burrito (a chimichanga) is truly a culinary experience and a gem of Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\ud83d\udccd El Charro Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/Rxm89YvKtk5qTw8k6\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Let\u2019s go eat! #BBQ #Phoenix #Arizona\n\nAs soon as you enter JL Smokehouse you know it\u2019s laid back and unique. JL as he calls himself, is the pitmaster, and knows his bbq. Although he offers brisket, chicken, sausages and an assortment of meats, his southern style bbq pork ribs and pulled pork are the true highlights and something you don\u2019t want to miss. \u201cI have the best pulled pork in the country,\u201d says Lewis, and when you see how the entire pork shoulder melts on the smoker, you know it\u2019s special. Before serving it, they chop it up coarsely and then squeeze on a generous amount of their legendary bbq sauce.\n\nI ordered the slugger combo plate, which included six different bbq meats and a few sides, plus I got an entire rack of pork ribs. JL showed me how he seasons the ribs with his own recipe dry rub, then smokes the ribs bone side down - never ever flipping them over. The pulled pork was indeed the best I\u2019ve had, so smoky, so ultra tender and bursting with flavor when combined with the tangy bbq sauce. JL mentioned that he didn\u2019t like to classify his bbq into any US regions, but did mention that it\u2019s influenced and similar to Memphis style bbq.\n\n\u201cPut Some South in Your Mouth!!\u201d - JL Smokehouse!!\n\nIt was an amazing experience to hang out with JL for a few hours and learn about his process of BBQ and to eat an amazing BBQ meal.

Along with a ton of amazingly delicious food, the chimichanga, which is a deep fried burrito often covered in sauce, was invented at a restaurant called El Charro Cafe! Today we\u2019re going to eat the original chimichanga, filled with carne seca, a spectacular sun dried beef.\n\nFriends in the video:\n\ud83d\udd39 Adam Lehrman: https://tucsonfoodie.com/ (https://www.instagram.com/tucsonfoodie/)\n\ud83d\udd39 Jeffrey Merrihue: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_merrihue/ - Stop by at Heroic Italian (https://g.page/heroicitalian?share) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!\n\ud83d\udd39 Mexi Papa: @mexipapaadventures  (https://www.instagram.com/mexi_papa_adventures/)\n\nIn 1922, Tia Monica Flin had a wrapped burrito in hand when she accidentally dropped it into the deep fat fryer. After being deep fried, it turned out it was a good thing, and they kept it! I love any accidental deep fry story and the chimichanga is no different. Today, they are known for a number of different things - inventing the original chimichanga, and carne seca, thin slices of beef which sun dry in a hanging cage above the restaurant. The carne seca is dried for two days, then shredded and cooked down with onions, tomatoes, and chilies. It\u2019s then filled into your chimichanga. The combination of deep fried crispy tortilla and the smoky condensed flavor of the carne seca was something truly special.\n\nJeffrey, Mexi Papa, Adam, and I, all agreed that this is a one of a kind restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious. Without a doubt one of the best Mexican American / Tex Mex restaurants I\u2019ve ever been too. That accidental deep fried burrito (a chimichanga) is truly a culinary experience and a gem of Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\ud83d\udccd El Charro Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/Rxm89YvKtk5qTw8k6\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Today, we are visiting a Hill Tribe Village of the Lawa People (\u0e25\u0e31\u0e27\u0e30). While many people groups in Northern Thailand trace their ancestry to South China (Yunnan) and Myanmar, the Lawa People (\u0e25\u0e31\u0e27\u0e30) are an indigenous to Thailand. They are cooking a unique dish, which is called to-sabuak, basically a boiled meat salad full of local herbs.

The village itself is spectacularly beautiful, on the peaks of mountains where they grow beans, starches, and now coffee. When we arrived they were ready to get started for our main dish. To make it, they simply boiled pork in water until it was fully cooked. I think one of the main key steps though was the roasted chilies which were charred before being pounded. When the pork was ready, they sliced it all up, and mixed it with chilies, lemongrass, coriander, and salt. The result was basically a pork boiled salad, full of vibrant local herbs.\n\nIt dawned on me, this could really be an original food of Thailand, an ancient method of cooking and simple technique of combining meat with herbs for seasoning.\n\nIt was delicious, simple, and satisfying.\n\nIt was also really cool to hang out with the Lawa People (\u0e25\u0e31\u0e27\u0e30) and especially to hang out with Aunty!\n\n\ud83d\udccd Ban La Oop Village (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e39\u0e1a): https://goo.gl/maps/FFmzd82jww1HgBJ67 - Ban La Oop Village (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e39\u0e1a) offers community tourism programs, including home-stays, learning about the local silver, local food, coffee, and other activities throughout the village.

The village has a lot of history where KMT fighters fled Yunnan, China and settled in this village. They brought with them their culture, Yunnanese tea, and Chinese food. Today, they village feels almost exactly like you\u2019re in China, and in a spectacular location, it\u2019s a popular place to visit. Today we\u2019re going to explore Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) and especially go on the ultimate Chinese food tour!\n\nKuay Teow Yunnan Pa Nuai (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e22\u0e39\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e27\u0e22 https://goo.gl/maps/qQj9rixfvKBbwfS39) - First thing to eat for breakfast is a bowl of Yunnanese yellow noodles. Aunty mixes them with sauces, chili oil, and garlic, gives them a hand toss. They are really tasted, highly recommended when you\u2019re in Ban Rak Thai. Total price - 110 THB ($3.68)\n\nLiXian Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/Zp6kkXsYh4xJTpfW8) - Next we headed to the small and friendly LiXian Restaurant where the owner makes a number of local Thai and Chinese dishes. One of the foods you have to eat when you\u2019re in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) is fresh tea leaf salad. She chops up the tea leaves, mixes it with chicken and seasoning and stirs it up. The result is a flavorful, green tasting, herbal salad that has so many flavors going on. As I mentioned in the video, it was a little too sweet, so next time I\u2019d ask for no sugar, but it was extremely delicious. Total price - 220 THB ($7.36)\n\nJee Lee Hot Pot (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e08\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e49 https://goo.gl/maps/dZnQg32EvLu78pCb6) - This ancient looking family run hot pot restaurant is one of the best of the best restaurants in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22). I would not go to Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) without eating here, it\u2019s a legendary culinary staple. They have a huge menu of all sorts of Yunnanese Chinese food, but one of their signature dishes is a hot pot that includes meat rolls, chicken, pork bones, taro, Yunnanese ham - basically any protein you name it, it\u2019s in there. It was delicious, warming, and rich. Total price - 840 THB ($28.10)\n\nDew Drop meat - 200 THB ($6.69) - Finally to end this Chinese street food tour in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), I wasn\u2019t going to leave without trying dew drop pork. The strips of pork literally hang and collect the morning dew for 30 days to age and preserve the meat. The result is a bacon / ham / dry aged taste that is spectacularly delicious. This small shop was right in the center square of Ban Rak Thai, and it\u2019s more of a shop than a restaurant, but they will serve you if you show up and buy some dew drop!\n\nWe had a fantastic time in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22).

The village has a lot of history where KMT fighters fled Yunnan, China and settled in this village. They brought with them their culture, Yunnanese tea, and Chinese food. Today, they village feels almost exactly like you\u2019re in China, and in a spectacular location, it\u2019s a popular place to visit. Today we\u2019re going to explore Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) and especially go on the ultimate Chinese food tour!\n\nKuay Teow Yunnan Pa Nuai (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e22\u0e39\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e27\u0e22 https://goo.gl/maps/qQj9rixfvKBbwfS39) - First thing to eat for breakfast is a bowl of Yunnanese yellow noodles. Aunty mixes them with sauces, chili oil, and garlic, gives them a hand toss. They are really tasted, highly recommended when you\u2019re in Ban Rak Thai. Total price - 110 THB ($3.68)\n\nLiXian Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/Zp6kkXsYh4xJTpfW8) - Next we headed to the small and friendly LiXian Restaurant where the owner makes a number of local Thai and Chinese dishes. One of the foods you have to eat when you\u2019re in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) is fresh tea leaf salad. She chops up the tea leaves, mixes it with chicken and seasoning and stirs it up. The result is a flavorful, green tasting, herbal salad that has so many flavors going on. As I mentioned in the video, it was a little too sweet, so next time I\u2019d ask for no sugar, but it was extremely delicious. Total price - 220 THB ($7.36)\n\nJee Lee Hot Pot (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e08\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e49 https://goo.gl/maps/dZnQg32EvLu78pCb6) - This ancient looking family run hot pot restaurant is one of the best of the best restaurants in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22). I would not go to Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) without eating here, it\u2019s a legendary culinary staple. They have a huge menu of all sorts of Yunnanese Chinese food, but one of their signature dishes is a hot pot that includes meat rolls, chicken, pork bones, taro, Yunnanese ham - basically any protein you name it, it\u2019s in there. It was delicious, warming, and rich. Total price - 840 THB ($28.10)\n\nDew Drop meat - 200 THB ($6.69) - Finally to end this Chinese street food tour in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), I wasn\u2019t going to leave without trying dew drop pork. The strips of pork literally hang and collect the morning dew for 30 days to age and preserve the meat. The result is a bacon / ham / dry aged taste that is spectacularly delicious. This small shop was right in the center square of Ban Rak Thai, and it\u2019s more of a shop than a restaurant, but they will serve you if you show up and buy some dew drop!\n\nWe had a fantastic time in Ban Rak Thai (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22). Again, it\u2019s a beautiful place, and it really feels like you\u2019ve left Thailand.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

She then sprinkled the entire plate of food with fried onions, crispy shallots, fried chilies, friend tomatoes, and garnished with more fresh vegetables - it was spectacular.\n\nWhat a meal and experience eating Thai Arabian food in Pattani, Thailand. Highly recommended when you visit Pattani!\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

                    "description": "HAT YAI, THAILAND - Along with fried chicken (watch the full tour here: https://youtu.be/lneXBB1Avm8), Hat Yai is also famous for its massive all you can eat seafood buffets! And let me tell you they have perfected the art of the all you can eat experience. #HatYai #Thailand #ThaiFood #seafood\n\nRim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19) - There are probably a dozen or so massive seafood buffets around Hat Yai (\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48), but I chose Rim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19), a nice leisure restaurant that\u2019s gigantic. It\u2019s a huge Thai family restaurant, and you can choose to sit outside in the yard, under the seafood area, or in the gymnasium sized meat area.\n\nYou have 2 options, the seafood buffet costs 339 THB (which is $10.88) for all you can eat crab, shellfish, fish, squid, shrimp, horseshoe crab salad and many more. And the 199 THB option (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30) which is lots of pork, meat, hot dogs, all the vegetables, some Thai food dishes, desserts, and more. If you choose the seafood option, you get both the seafood buffet section and the meat buffet section.\n\nThe best thing about this street food buffet is that you get to cook everything in front of you on your table - grilling and boiling seafood right in front of your face while you\u2019re eating it. It\u2019s a similar experience to buffets across Thailand, but Hat Yai has truly perfected the art of the all you can eat Thai seafood buffet.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\nRim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19): https://goo.gl/maps/QVdxAQ79nz3XBjA66\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

                        "description": "HAT YAI, THAILAND - Along with fried chicken (watch the full tour here: https://youtu.be/lneXBB1Avm8), Hat Yai is also famous for its massive all you can eat seafood buffets! And let me tell you they have perfected the art of the all you can eat experience. #HatYai #Thailand #ThaiFood #seafood\n\nRim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19) - There are probably a dozen or so massive seafood buffets around Hat Yai (\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48), but I chose Rim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19), a nice leisure restaurant that\u2019s gigantic. It\u2019s a huge Thai family restaurant, and you can choose to sit outside in the yard, under the seafood area, or in the gymnasium sized meat area.\n\nYou have 2 options, the seafood buffet costs 339 THB (which is $10.88) for all you can eat crab, shellfish, fish, squid, shrimp, horseshoe crab salad and many more. And the 199 THB option (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30) which is lots of pork, meat, hot dogs, all the vegetables, some Thai food dishes, desserts, and more. If you choose the seafood option, you get both the seafood buffet section and the meat buffet section.\n\nThe best thing about this street food buffet is that you get to cook everything in front of you on your table - grilling and boiling seafood right in front of your face while you\u2019re eating it. It\u2019s a similar experience to buffets across Thailand, but Hat Yai has truly perfected the art of the all you can eat Thai seafood buffet.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\nRim Rua Kratha Ron Buffet (\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19): https://goo.gl/maps/QVdxAQ79nz3XBjA66\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It was my first time to visit and I was thrilled to have a chance to explore the amazing food and mix of cultures. But of all the delicious street food in Hat Yai, there\u2019s nothing more famous than Hat Yai Fried Chicken (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48). Get ready for an ultimate fried chicken street food tour! #HatYai #Thailand #streetfood #friedchicken\n\nWhen you mention fried chicken in Thailand, immediately people from the entire country will think about Hat Yai, and you can find Hat Yai style Thai fried chicken in pretty much every town and village throughout Thailand. There are a couple things to first know about this style of fried chicken. Number one is that it\u2019s usually a very light batter - not bready. The marinade often includes some Thai spices like coriander seed and roots, pepper, and sometimes milk. The chicken is fried so all the golden crispiness is coating the meat rather than on the breading. Next, Hat Yai Fried Chicken (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48) is almost always eaten with sticky rice. Finally, it would not be Hat Yai Fried Chicken (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48) without crispy fried shallots. That combination is what makes it what it is, and it\u2019s crazy good.\n\nHere are the places we ate:\n\nLaila Fried Chicken (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e44\u0e25\u0e25\u0e32) - https://goo.gl/maps/xHiCisnySpvCXaKP8 - First we headed to this amazing street food stall for popular fried chicken, especially catering to students from the Prince of Songkhla University. Fried chicken was excellent, and they are extremely friendly.\n\nBa Sao Fried Chicken (\u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e19) - https://goo.gl/maps/akeF6xsgRYyYdDut8 - What\u2019s especially cool about this old school fried chicken stall is they still cook over wood fire.

I was excited to have a chance to visit Sacha Farm (\u0e1f\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e30\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32), a goat farm, run by a Pakistani Thai family who has been in Thailand for generations. And even more exciting, they cooking Thai style Pakistani food, and have one numerous Thai culinary awards for their goat curry. We arrived to the farm, and immediately you could feel the friendliness of the family. The food was outstanding!\n#PakistaniFood #ThaiFood #Trang #Thailand\n\nHere are the main dishes they cooked at the farm, using their fresh goat meat that they raise:\n\nGoat chili dip (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e30) - This is the ultimate Thai Pakistani food combination - a chili dip is essential in Southern Thai food and there are dozens of variations. I\u2019ve eaten plenty of types of \u201cnam prik,\u201d but goat nam prik, was a first for me. It was spicy, salty, balanced with a sweetness, and full of mixed goat, tomato puree, and spices. It went incredibly well with fresh hot roti.\n\nGoat curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e30) - We already were lucky enough to get a taste of their amazing goat curry, but they still wanted to make a fresh batch. Their recipe is very much Southern Thai, but with spices and a taste that also resembled Pakistani food - again it was a fusion of Pakistani and Thai food all in one life-changing curry. They used both a fresh herb curry paste - typical of Thai curries - and a powder curry paste - typical of Pakistani curries. And also different from typical Pakistani food, instead of using oil or ghee, they used only coconut milk - and a lot of it - to make the curry rich and thick. The curry was outstanding, nutty, and full of complex flavor - truly a unique dish I had never had, and the taste was spectacular.\n\nGoat biryani (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e30) - Finally they wanted to make Thai Pakistani biryani, and so they first make a pot of the curry paste, then added in boiled boat meat, added the rice to the curry paste mixture, and let it cook, to mingle all the spices. Again, another delicious dish, this biryani was more of the Thai side taste for me - excellent.\n\nWe had a great time eating fresh goat meat, award winning - champion goat curry, and learning about their history as a Thai Pakistani family.\n\nHuge thank you to Sacha Farm (\u0e1f\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e30\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32) for hosting us.

Along with specializing in kayaking down the river in the jungle, the village community is home to a unique breed of black chicken. The chicken is a combination of an Indonesian black chicken plus a number of Thai chicken breeds, which were co-breeded to create a truly unique and delicious chicken. They have two types of black chicken, one that\u2019s completely black, including the organs and bones and feathers. But the one we tried, and the one they are most known for has white feathers, but the rest of the chicken is completely black - including the bones.\n\nAt the village, the lady\u2019s in the community cooked us an unbelievable array of delicious Southern Thai food using this unique black chicken. The main dish was a Thai curry including tons of curry paste, fresh galangal, black chicken, and coconut milk. The next dish they made was a black chicken soup with turmeric.\n\nI was just amazed at the quality of the black chicken, and we actually ate a black rooster. The meat was unbelievably tasty, and the texture is what truly stood out. Lean, chewy but not overly so, flavorful with every bite, and as they say, with unique health and antioxidant properties.\n\nThank you to the Baan Khao Lak (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01) for hosting us for this unique black chicken meal experience.

It was my first time visit, and I was very excited to explore some of the best Thai street food in Sukhothai, and to also visit the Sukhothai Historical Park. Let\u2019s explore and eat through Sukhothai, Thailand! #Sukhothai #ThaiFood #streetfood\n\nMarket - We started the morning at the local market, within the old part of Sukhothai. The market was quiet and charming, not too busy, but friendly. There wasn't a lot of pre-cooked food to eat, but mainly ingredients. \n\nGrilled banana (\u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22) - 5 THB ($0.16) - We did find some delicious grilled bananas and rice snacks at the front of the market grilling in banana leaf packets. One of them tasted like fresh banana bread, which was great.\n\nTa Puy Noodle (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22\u0e15\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e38\u0e49\u0e22) - Even though there wasn\u2019t much food to eat at the market, that was alright, because our main breakfast in Sukhothai was to eat famous Sukhothai noodles, which are well known across Thailand, especially famous in Bangkok. We went to a restaurant that is know to serve the original Sukhothai Noodles (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22). The noodles were very good, kind of sweet for me, but well balanced in flavor at the same time. I did really like their variation of Pad Thai. Price - 40 THB ($1.30) per bowl\n\nSukhothai Historical Park - 100 THB ($3.24) - Next on this Thai street food tour of Sukhothai, we did some sightseeing of the amazing Sukhothai Historical Park. It\u2019s one of the best and most preserved ancient sites of Thailand. We rented bicycles and cruised around, visiting some of the most iconic historical sites:\n\nWat Maha That (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\nWat Si Sawai (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\nWat Si Chum (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\n\nFuang Fah Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32) - When the sun got really hot, we headed to Fuang Fah Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32) restaurant in Sukhothai city for a spicy meal of river fish. The owner family was so nice and hospitable, and we ordered some of their most unique special dishes. Here are a few of the special dishes we ordered:\n\nCrunchy catfish curry (\u0e09\u0e39\u0e48\u0e09\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e1f\u0e39)\nAsian redtail catfish, fresh chili (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e04\u0e31\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e14)\nSnakehead fish tom yum (\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19)\n\nFood was spectacular, and I loved how she added in chili paste, fresh and dry chilies to each dish to give them huge spice and flavor. An amazing meal, must eat at a restaurant when you\u2019re in Sukhothai and if you love spicy food!\nTotal price - 790 THB ($25.60)\n\nWe completed this tour of Sukhothai, Thailand by going to Wat Si Chum (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22). Although it was already closed when we arrived, it was still possible to walk around and see from the outside. It was a great way to end an amazing day in Sukhothai, Thailand!\n\nThank you for watching this full Thai street food and attractions tour of Sukhothai, Thailand!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It was my first time visit, and I was very excited to explore some of the best Thai street food in Sukhothai, and to also visit the Sukhothai Historical Park. Let\u2019s explore and eat through Sukhothai, Thailand! #Sukhothai #ThaiFood #streetfood\n\nMarket - We started the morning at the local market, within the old part of Sukhothai. The market was quiet and charming, not too busy, but friendly. There wasn't a lot of pre-cooked food to eat, but mainly ingredients. \n\nGrilled banana (\u0e02\u0e19\u0e21\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22) - 5 THB ($0.16) - We did find some delicious grilled bananas and rice snacks at the front of the market grilling in banana leaf packets. One of them tasted like fresh banana bread, which was great.\n\nTa Puy Noodle (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22\u0e15\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e38\u0e49\u0e22) - Even though there wasn\u2019t much food to eat at the market, that was alright, because our main breakfast in Sukhothai was to eat famous Sukhothai noodles, which are well known across Thailand, especially famous in Bangkok. We went to a restaurant that is know to serve the original Sukhothai Noodles (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22). The noodles were very good, kind of sweet for me, but well balanced in flavor at the same time. I did really like their variation of Pad Thai. Price - 40 THB ($1.30) per bowl\n\nSukhothai Historical Park - 100 THB ($3.24) - Next on this Thai street food tour of Sukhothai, we did some sightseeing of the amazing Sukhothai Historical Park. It\u2019s one of the best and most preserved ancient sites of Thailand. We rented bicycles and cruised around, visiting some of the most iconic historical sites:\n\nWat Maha That (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\nWat Si Sawai (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\nWat Si Chum (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22)\n\nFuang Fah Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32) - When the sun got really hot, we headed to Fuang Fah Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32) restaurant in Sukhothai city for a spicy meal of river fish. The owner family was so nice and hospitable, and we ordered some of their most unique special dishes. Here are a few of the special dishes we ordered:\n\nCrunchy catfish curry (\u0e09\u0e39\u0e48\u0e09\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e1f\u0e39)\nAsian redtail catfish, fresh chili (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e04\u0e31\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e14)\nSnakehead fish tom yum (\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19)\n\nFood was spectacular, and I loved how she added in chili paste, fresh and dry chilies to each dish to give them huge spice and flavor. An amazing meal, must eat at a restaurant when you\u2019re in Sukhothai and if you love spicy food!\nTotal price - 790 THB ($25.60)\n\nWe completed this tour of Sukhothai, Thailand by going to Wat Si Chum (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21 \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22). Although it was already closed when we arrived, it was still possible to walk around and see from the outside. It was a great way to end an amazing day in Sukhothai, Thailand!\n\nThank you for watching this full Thai street food and attractions tour of Sukhothai, Thailand!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

They have an amazing homestay program where you can arrange to stay and learn about the amazing culture and eat some incredibly delicious local home-cooked food! #Sukhothai #ThaiFood\n\nSukhothai is the ancient capital of Siam, and so there\u2019s a lot of Thai culture and history here. Along with visiting the historical sites of Sukhothai (https://youtu.be/Oh3PFsNqr78), I was very excited to learn more about the culture and especially eat authentic local Sukhothai Thai food.\n\nAfter we arrived to Ban Na Ton Chan (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19), we immediately went to check into our homestay where we were greeted by an amazing local early lunch. Among the spread of food, one of the highlights was barometer earthstar mushroom curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e14\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e32\u0e30), it was incredibly delicious. We ate, had some local durian, and then took a little rest before preparing the next meal!\n\nAunty was amazing, she went above and beyond to take care of us, and to cook us local food. In the afternoon we went to gather some fresh ingredients, including bamboo shoots, bitter melon leaves, and pea eggplant. Along with many other dishes, one of the main dishes Aunty cooked was a local style bamboo shoot curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49) \u0e43\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07), using mainly the fresh herbs and bamboo shoots that we harvested ourselves. She started with juice made from yanang (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiliacora_triandra) leaves, which are common in certain regions of Thailand, often used for a curry broth. She then boiled the bamboo shoots, and added in an assortment of vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, spices, fermented fish sauce, and finally red ant eggs to finish it off. It was extraordinary!\n\nFor dinner we had an entire local Sukhothai Thai food feast - including the amazing bamboo shoot curry Aunty prepared, a chili dip made with egg, and an assortment of other delicious Thai food.\n\nIt was a learning experience, and so much fun to hang out with Aunty who was so kind and took such great care of us.\n\nSukhothai (\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22) Ban Na Ton Chan (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19) \u0e42\u0e2e\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e15\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\nPrice for homestay - 600 THB ($19.31) per person, Includes dinner and breakfast\n\nThank you for watching this Thai food video, and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

They have an amazing homestay program where you can arrange to stay and learn about the amazing culture and eat some incredibly delicious local home-cooked food! #Sukhothai #ThaiFood\n\nSukhothai is the ancient capital of Siam, and so there\u2019s a lot of Thai culture and history here. Along with visiting the historical sites of Sukhothai (https://youtu.be/Oh3PFsNqr78), I was very excited to learn more about the culture and especially eat authentic local Sukhothai Thai food.\n\nAfter we arrived to Ban Na Ton Chan (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19), we immediately went to check into our homestay where we were greeted by an amazing local early lunch. Among the spread of food, one of the highlights was barometer earthstar mushroom curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e14\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e32\u0e30), it was incredibly delicious. We ate, had some local durian, and then took a little rest before preparing the next meal!\n\nAunty was amazing, she went above and beyond to take care of us, and to cook us local food. In the afternoon we went to gather some fresh ingredients, including bamboo shoots, bitter melon leaves, and pea eggplant. Along with many other dishes, one of the main dishes Aunty cooked was a local style bamboo shoot curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49) \u0e43\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07), using mainly the fresh herbs and bamboo shoots that we harvested ourselves. She started with juice made from yanang (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiliacora_triandra) leaves, which are common in certain regions of Thailand, often used for a curry broth. She then boiled the bamboo shoots, and added in an assortment of vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, spices, fermented fish sauce, and finally red ant eggs to finish it off. It was extraordinary!\n\nFor dinner we had an entire local Sukhothai Thai food feast - including the amazing bamboo shoot curry Aunty prepared, a chili dip made with egg, and an assortment of other delicious Thai food.\n\nIt was a learning experience, and so much fun to hang out with Aunty who was so kind and took such great care of us.\n\nSukhothai (\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22) Ban Na Ton Chan (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19) \u0e42\u0e2e\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e15\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\nPrice for homestay - 600 THB ($19.31) per person, Includes dinner and breakfast\n\nThank you for watching this Thai food video, and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

But all the dishes were fantastic and I loved the setting and the amazing Southern Thai food.\n\nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Uncle Tom is an amazing man, friendly and care, and he knows his seafood.\n\nFirst, we took the boat to Uncle Tom\u2019s oyster plot in the brackish open waters of the bay. He pulled out giant strands of oysters soaking in the salty water. It was pretty cool to see.\n\nThen we headed over to Uncle Tom\u2019s floating raft restaurant where his wife was already busy preparing a huge Thai seafood meal. She cooked half a dozen dishes, including the massive oysters. The food was awesome, the setting was perfect.

Watch all 8 videos here:\n\nWelcome to Day 1 of my Eastern Thailand food and travel tour. Eastern Thailand is in my opinion often overlooked or underrepresented when it comes to Thai food. Many people do visit, but they tend to go straight to some of the popular islands like Koh Chang immediately, while passing the rest. Even in Bangkok, just a couple hours drive away, you\u2019ll rarely find any Eastern Thai food. So in this series of videos (), my goal was to learn about Eastern Thai food, culture, and travels, and share it all with you.\n\nChanthaburi (\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) is about a 3 hour drive from Bangkok, and this is where we began. Chanthaburi is a charming little town, next to a river, and plenty of history. One of the icons is the Catholic Church, which is the biggest in Thailand.\n\nHere\u2019s all the Thai food we ate and things we did on this tour of Chanthaburi, Thailand:\n\nMorning Market (\u0e15\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e21\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07)\nGrilled sticky rice (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07) - 10 THB ($0.32)\nGrilled chicken (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07) - 15 THB ($0.48)\nChanthaburi noodles (\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e39) - 30 THB ($0.96) - These are one of the unique speciality dishes of Chanthaburi, crab noodles that you need to try. They are very sweet, but quite addictive.\n\nJe Eat Reem Nam (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e4a\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e4a\u0e14 \u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33) - Overall, the bowls of noodles here were quite tasty, though portion sizes were quite small. The restaurant is iconic and located in a great location.\nTom yum seafood noodles (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25)\nRice seafood (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25)\nTotal price - 200 THB ($6.39)\n\nCathedral of Immaculate Conception - This is one of the iconic landmarks and one of the places you must visit in Chanthaburi.\n\nFish cake (\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e32\u0e19) - He watches our videos and saw me walking by.

Watch all 8 videos here:\n\nWelcome to Day 1 of my Eastern Thailand food and travel tour. Eastern Thailand is in my opinion often overlooked or underrepresented when it comes to Thai food. Many people do visit, but they tend to go straight to some of the popular islands like Koh Chang immediately, while passing the rest. Even in Bangkok, just a couple hours drive away, you\u2019ll rarely find any Eastern Thai food. So in this series of videos (), my goal was to learn about Eastern Thai food, culture, and travels, and share it all with you.\n\nChanthaburi (\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) is about a 3 hour drive from Bangkok, and this is where we began. Chanthaburi is a charming little town, next to a river, and plenty of history. One of the icons is the Catholic Church, which is the biggest in Thailand.\n\nHere\u2019s all the Thai food we ate and things we did on this tour of Chanthaburi, Thailand:\n\nMorning Market (\u0e15\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e21\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07)\nGrilled sticky rice (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07) - 10 THB ($0.32)\nGrilled chicken (\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07) - 15 THB ($0.48)\nChanthaburi noodles (\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e39) - 30 THB ($0.96) - These are one of the unique speciality dishes of Chanthaburi, crab noodles that you need to try. They are very sweet, but quite addictive.\n\nJe Eat Reem Nam (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e4a\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e4a\u0e14 \u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33) - Overall, the bowls of noodles here were quite tasty, though portion sizes were quite small. The restaurant is iconic and located in a great location.\nTom yum seafood noodles (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25)\nRice seafood (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25)\nTotal price - 200 THB ($6.39)\n\nCathedral of Immaculate Conception - This is one of the iconic landmarks and one of the places you must visit in Chanthaburi.\n\nFish cake (\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e32\u0e19) - He watches our videos and saw me walking by.

In this ultimate Miami food tour we\u2019ll eat at some of the legendary restaurants in Miami including the Cuban sandwich, Cuban burger, and colossal sized Florida stone crab claws! #Miami #Florida #MiamiFood\n\nI met up with my friend David Hoffman, I\u2019ve known him for years, but this is the first time to meet him in his hometown of Miami. He actually picked us up from the airport and we immediately got started eating.\n\nHere are the places we ate in this Miami food tour:\n\nVersailles Restaurant Cuban Cuisine - Nowhere is more legendary for food in Miami than Versailles Restaurant, specializing in Cuban food, and known for their Cuban coffee and Cuban sandwich. We first started at the coffee bar, for some Cuban coffee and pastries - loved the ham croquetas and the guava and cheese empanada. Then we had the honor to watch a classic 1 meter Cuban sandwich being made and then eating it. It was everything it needed to be, a sandwich of history. \n\nEl Rey De Las Fritas - Next we headed to El Rey De Las Fritas for the Cuban burger, an impressively French fry filled burger loaded with seasonings and sauces. David, Joel, and I, all shared the Frita Suprema, Frita Original, and the Frita a Caballo. Oh man it was good, dripping with greasy flavor. El Rey De Las Fritas is truly a must eat gem of Miami.\n\nAnd that completes Part 1 of this Ultimate Miami Food Tour. Stay tuned and keep watching Part 2.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

He actually picked us up from the airport and we immediately got started eating.\n\nHere are the places we ate in this Miami food tour:\n\nVersailles Restaurant Cuban Cuisine - Nowhere is more legendary for food in Miami than Versailles Restaurant, specializing in Cuban food, and known for their Cuban coffee and Cuban sandwich. We first started at the coffee bar, for some Cuban coffee and pastries - loved the ham croquetas and the guava and cheese empanada. Then we had the honor to watch a classic 1 meter Cuban sandwich being made and then eating it. It was everything it needed to be, a sandwich of history. \n\nEl Rey De Las Fritas - Next we headed to El Rey De Las Fritas for the Cuban burger, an impressively French fry filled burger loaded with seasonings and sauces. David, Joel, and I, all shared the Frita Suprema, Frita Original, and the Frita a Caballo. Oh man it was good, dripping with greasy flavor. El Rey De Las Fritas is truly a must eat gem of Miami.\n\nAnd that completes Part 1 of this Ultimate Miami Food Tour. Stay tuned and keep watching Part 2.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

On this trip to Phang Nga, it was an honor to meet P\u2019Aey (\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e4b), chef and owner of Khrua Nong restaurant, located specifically in Takua Pa (\u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32), Phang Nga.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: We were driving towards a beach area called Khao Lak one evening and we needed to quickly stop just for a fast dinner as my son and wife were hungry. We stopped at a small roadside southern Thai restaurant, and it happened to be Khrua Nong Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07). The owner and chef knew us from watching our videos. And was we ate, I loved the food and his authenticity and hospitality. So I said, we need to come back, film a video of the food, and maybe go to the market to see P\u2019Aey shop for some of the seafood and ingredients he uses at his restaurant.

On this trip to Phang Nga, it was an honor to meet P\u2019Aey (\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e4b), chef and owner of Khrua Nong restaurant, located specifically in Takua Pa (\u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32), Phang Nga.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: We were driving towards a beach area called Khao Lak one evening and we needed to quickly stop just for a fast dinner as my son and wife were hungry. We stopped at a small roadside southern Thai restaurant, and it happened to be Khrua Nong Restaurant (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07). The owner and chef knew us from watching our videos. And was we ate, I loved the food and his authenticity and hospitality. So I said, we need to come back, film a video of the food, and maybe go to the market to see P\u2019Aey shop for some of the seafood and ingredients he uses at his restaurant. Also, after eating there, I realized his restaurant was featured in the Thailand Michelin food guide.\n\nThe next day we met up with P\u2019Aey at the market and bought some amazing fresh fish including a huge flat shaped jack fish and a big barracuda.

Turned out to be one of the best Thai food meals I\u2019ve had in a long time, one of my new favorite restaurants in all of Thailand.\n\nWe arrived in the morning just as they opened, and already Chef was extremely friendly and welcoming. We ordered a bunch of dishes - and they have some unique southern Thai food dishes that you won\u2019t find elsewhere - so I was extremely excited.\n\nHere are the main dishes we ordered: \n\nSour curry sea catfish \u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25\nBeef dry curry \u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\nFried fish turmeric \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e02\u0e21\u0e34\u0e49\u0e19\nBlack stingray curry \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e47\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e14\u0e33\nRed ant omelet \u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e21\u0e14\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07\nOctopus pineapple \u0e42\u0e27\u0e22\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e30\u0e23\u0e14\nSea shells \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e15\u0e35\u0e19\nStir fried morning glory \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e49\u0e07\n\nTotal price - 1,800 THB ($55.46)\n\nBefore eating, I had a chance to watch Chef as he masterfully cooked all the dishes. His insane skills and use of huge amounts of spice blew my taste buds before even starting to eat. He makes all his own curry pastes, and sources all his ingredients locally. \n\nThe food was absolutely insane, bold, spicy, tingly, and a sensation for the tongue. Mind blowing flavor, and strong to the max curries. I loved every bite, and the entire experience.\n\nKhrua Luang Then (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19) is located in Khao Lak (\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01), Phang Nga province (\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32) in southern Thailand.

Turned out to be one of the best Thai food meals I\u2019ve had in a long time, one of my new favorite restaurants in all of Thailand.\n\nWe arrived in the morning just as they opened, and already Chef was extremely friendly and welcoming. We ordered a bunch of dishes - and they have some unique southern Thai food dishes that you won\u2019t find elsewhere - so I was extremely excited.\n\nHere are the main dishes we ordered: \n\nSour curry sea catfish \u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e38\u0e01\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25\nBeef dry curry \u0e04\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\nFried fish turmeric \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e02\u0e21\u0e34\u0e49\u0e19\nBlack stingray curry \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e47\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e14\u0e33\nRed ant omelet \u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e21\u0e14\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07\nOctopus pineapple \u0e42\u0e27\u0e22\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e30\u0e23\u0e14\nSea shells \u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e15\u0e35\u0e19\nStir fried morning glory \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e49\u0e07\n\nTotal price - 1,800 THB ($55.46)\n\nBefore eating, I had a chance to watch Chef as he masterfully cooked all the dishes. His insane skills and use of huge amounts of spice blew my taste buds before even starting to eat. He makes all his own curry pastes, and sources all his ingredients locally. \n\nThe food was absolutely insane, bold, spicy, tingly, and a sensation for the tongue. Mind blowing flavor, and strong to the max curries. I loved every bite, and the entire experience.\n\nKhrua Luang Then (\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19) is located in Khao Lak (\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01), Phang Nga province (\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32) in southern Thailand.

Today we\u2019re going to pick and eat one of my favorite fruits - Cempedak (In Thai it\u2019s known as a jambada \u0e08\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e30). #fruit #cempedak #plantbased\n \nWe were lucky to be in Southern Thailand during cempedak season. It\u2019s a very seasonal fruit, and it doesn\u2019t travel well - so even just 800 kilometers away in Bangkok it\u2019s very rare to ever find cempedak. But during season in Southern Thailand, it\u2019s everywhere. I\u2019ve eat cempedak countless times, but this was my first time to see it on the tree, growing. And what a sight that is, so much fruit, it\u2019s incredible. We picked a few, and ate both the fruit seeds, and the pulpy outer flesh which is extremely good.\n \nThe next day we stopped at a common roadside stall and ate a huge cempedak. And finally to finish off this guide to cempedak, we were at a local market where we ate some deep fried cempedak. Although it\u2019s not the healthiest option, it\u2019s so good. I love especially that when the cempedak is cooked, you can eat the seeds.\n \nIf you have a chance, don\u2019t miss eating cempedak fruit - and unique and exotic Southeast Asian fruit, especially common in Southern Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of Indonesia.\n \nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Today we\u2019re going to pick and eat one of my favorite fruits - Cempedak (In Thai it\u2019s known as a jambada \u0e08\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e30). #fruit #cempedak #plantbased\n \nWe were lucky to be in Southern Thailand during cempedak season. It\u2019s a very seasonal fruit, and it doesn\u2019t travel well - so even just 800 kilometers away in Bangkok it\u2019s very rare to ever find cempedak. But during season in Southern Thailand, it\u2019s everywhere. I\u2019ve eat cempedak countless times, but this was my first time to see it on the tree, growing. And what a sight that is, so much fruit, it\u2019s incredible. We picked a few, and ate both the fruit seeds, and the pulpy outer flesh which is extremely good.\n \nThe next day we stopped at a common roadside stall and ate a huge cempedak. And finally to finish off this guide to cempedak, we were at a local market where we ate some deep fried cempedak. Although it\u2019s not the healthiest option, it\u2019s so good. I love especially that when the cempedak is cooked, you can eat the seeds.\n \nIf you have a chance, don\u2019t miss eating cempedak fruit - and unique and exotic Southeast Asian fruit, especially common in Southern Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of Indonesia.\n \nThank you for watching and hope you\u2019re having a fantastic day!\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/CNfD7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4c100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: \nhttp://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Cook and eat #withme #streetfoodathome #Pakistan #PakistaniFood #recipes\n\nTraveling through Pakistan for the amazing food with my friend Ali Hamdani (https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/) was one of the most memorable trips I\u2019ve taken. If there\u2019s one single dish that represents the incredible food, culture, and community of Pakistan, it has to be a karahi.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re heading to the street food cart at home, and we\u2019re going to cook an authentic Pakistani street food chicken karahi recipe. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nIngredients (and please note, these are estimates, I\u2019m a firm believer in taste testing, so feel free to add more or less according to your taste):\n\n1 chicken - about 1 kg, could be more\n\u00bc cup oil - vegetable oil with high smoke point\n\n8 cloves of garlic\n50 grams ginger\nSalt to taste\n5 tomatoes - up to you depending on how tomatoey you want it\n\n1 tbsp cumin\n1 tbsp coriander powder\n1 tbsp chili powder\n1 tbsp garam masala\n\u00bd tbsp black pepper\n\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n\n10 - 15 green chilies\n1 - 2 tbsp dry fenugreek leaves\n\nSlice of butter - at some places they use an entire block of butter per karahi - but at home I used a slice, about 20 grams.\n\n30 grams ginger - julienne slices for garnish\nFresh coriander - handful chopped\nMore green chilies to garnish on top\n\nMethod:\n\nFirst heat the oil, and fry the chicken until golden on edges.\nPeel and pound ginger and garlic, and add to chicken.\nAdd in salt to taste - \u00bd tsp first\nToss in the tomatoes, and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. You can add water if it get dry.\nWhen the tomatoes are soft, remove the skin, and mash tomatoes into a sauce. Cook until tomatoes are fully dissolved and chicken is tender.\nAdd in all the dry spices - cumin powder, coriander powder, chili powder, garam masala, black pepper, and turmeric powder. Continuously stir, and add water if it gets too dry.\nAdd sliced green chilies, and fenugreek leaves. Continue to simmer.\nAdd butter. Continue to simmer, but at this time you want much of the liquid to boil out so you\u2019re left with a thick spice rich sauce.\nJulienne the ginger, coarsely chop the coriander leaves, and cut in half some more green chilies. At the end, toss them all in, fold into the chicken, and turn off the heat.\nReady to serve.\nBest eaten with any time of flatbread.\n\nSimple roti\n250 grams Atta flour\n200 ml water - You may need to adjust\n\nFriends in the video:\nAli Hamdani: https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/\nDwight Turner: https://www.instagram.com/bkkfatty/\n\nThank you for watching this Pakistani street food style chicken karahi recipe.

Cook and eat #withme #streetfoodathome #Pakistan #PakistaniFood #recipes\n\nTraveling through Pakistan for the amazing food with my friend Ali Hamdani (https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/) was one of the most memorable trips I\u2019ve taken. If there\u2019s one single dish that represents the incredible food, culture, and community of Pakistan, it has to be a karahi.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re heading to the street food cart at home, and we\u2019re going to cook an authentic Pakistani street food chicken karahi recipe. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nIngredients (and please note, these are estimates, I\u2019m a firm believer in taste testing, so feel free to add more or less according to your taste):\n\n1 chicken - about 1 kg, could be more\n\u00bc cup oil - vegetable oil with high smoke point\n\n8 cloves of garlic\n50 grams ginger\nSalt to taste\n5 tomatoes - up to you depending on how tomatoey you want it\n\n1 tbsp cumin\n1 tbsp coriander powder\n1 tbsp chili powder\n1 tbsp garam masala\n\u00bd tbsp black pepper\n\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n\n10 - 15 green chilies\n1 - 2 tbsp dry fenugreek leaves\n\nSlice of butter - at some places they use an entire block of butter per karahi - but at home I used a slice, about 20 grams.\n\n30 grams ginger - julienne slices for garnish\nFresh coriander - handful chopped\nMore green chilies to garnish on top\n\nMethod:\n\nFirst heat the oil, and fry the chicken until golden on edges.\nPeel and pound ginger and garlic, and add to chicken.\nAdd in salt to taste - \u00bd tsp first\nToss in the tomatoes, and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. You can add water if it get dry.\nWhen the tomatoes are soft, remove the skin, and mash tomatoes into a sauce. Cook until tomatoes are fully dissolved and chicken is tender.\nAdd in all the dry spices - cumin powder, coriander powder, chili powder, garam masala, black pepper, and turmeric powder. Continuously stir, and add water if it gets too dry.\nAdd sliced green chilies, and fenugreek leaves. Continue to simmer.\nAdd butter. Continue to simmer, but at this time you want much of the liquid to boil out so you\u2019re left with a thick spice rich sauce.\nJulienne the ginger, coarsely chop the coriander leaves, and cut in half some more green chilies. At the end, toss them all in, fold into the chicken, and turn off the heat.\nReady to serve.\nBest eaten with any time of flatbread.\n\nSimple roti\n250 grams Atta flour\n200 ml water - You may need to adjust\n\nFriends in the video:\nAli Hamdani: https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/\nDwight Turner: https://www.instagram.com/bkkfatty/\n\nThank you for watching this Pakistani street food style chicken karahi recipe.

And 10 days in Jamaica didn\u2019t let me know - the food, amazing people, and adventure we had on this island were unforgettable. Stay tuned for a full Jamaican food and travel video series throughout this gorgeous Caribbean island.\n\nWe begin this trip with a Jamaican street food tour in Kingston, the largest city in Jamaica, and a great place to explore and get a feel of city life, and a mix of cultures represented in Jamaica.\n\nCoronation Market - As one of the biggest outdoor food markets in Jamaica and the Caribbean, you can be assured, Coronation Market is a bustling, colorful, paradise of fruits and vegetables. You\u2019ll find everything you need here to make Jamaican food - from Scotch bonnet chilies to ackee. It\u2019s fantastic. On the way out of the market, we found a man selling soup - Jamaican bean soup with cow skin, and pumpkin soup with chicken feet. It was spectacular. Soup - 120 JMD ($0.88) per bowl\n\nNational Heroes Circle - Alice Stall - Next up on this Jamaican street food tour, we headed to National Heroes Circle, known for its street food stalls that sell spicy crabs, soups, and corn. The crab was delicious, simmered with thyme and scotch bonnet chilies. The corn was served with chunks of mature coconut, an amazing combination. And finally Alice, makes some amazing pumpkin soup, full of chicken feet and organs - don\u2019t miss it in Kingston. Crab and everything - 2,600 JMD for everyone - there were about 8 of us.\n\nIbo Spice Portal - This was an unplanned spot on this food tour - we found it and decided to go check it out. Turned out to be an amazing experience. So Ital food, comes from the world Vital, which is typically a Rastafari way to eat - typically vegetarian, focusing on natural and local ingredients. Ibo Spice Portal is a small Rasta community yard where they always have food cooking and juices brewing. It\u2019s friendly, relaxed, artistic, and the food is delicious. We all enjoyed the mix of vegetarian food, served in a calabash. Also, the guava soursop juice was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Ital vegan food - 700 JMD ($5.12) per bowl\n\nJerk Pan Chicken - Red Hills Road - Finally to finish this Jamaican street food tour of Kingston, we had to eat jerk pan chicken, a staple street food of Jamaica, and something so tasty, you can\u2019t resist. Red Hills Road is the famous pan chicken spot in Kingston and vendors line the road with the barrel grills. The chicken is grilled, slathered in sauce, and topped with bread. Pan chicken - 500 JMD ($3.66) per pack\n\nThank you for watching this Jamaican street food tour of Kingston.

We headed to the river, to cook up Jamaican curry goat, oxtail stew, and ackee and saltfish. Turned into an epic meal, great people, and an ultimate food experience in Jamaica.\n\nWe had the pleasure to hang out with Matt Robinson - The Jamaica Food Boss. He\u2019s such a cool guy, has a huge heart for Jamaican food, and he\u2019s so knowledgeable as well. He offers amazing food tours in Jamaica. Check them out when you\u2019re in Montego Bay: https://www.jafoodtours.com/\n\nSunday is family day in Jamaica and so we all headed out to the river for a Jamaican curry goat link-up! But to get there, we took a bamboo raft, something that\u2019s known in Jamaica, and extremely fun and relaxing. It was about a 15 minute bamboo raft ride to get to the site where Matt and the Chef\u2019s were setting up and ready to prepare this epic Jamaicna food feast.\n\n- Curry Goat - It would not be a party or a get together in Jamaica without curry goat, and it\u2019s one of Jamaica\u2019s best dishes.\n- Oxtail stew - We also made oxtail stew, a rich blend of oxtail including the meat, fat, and skin. The texture was insane.\n- Ackee and Saltfish - Additionally Chef made ackee and saltfish, the national food of Jamaica and easily my favorite dish of Jamaica as well. Loved it!\n- Peppa shrimp - And to begin this incredible meal, we started with some peppa shrimp - scotch bonnet pepper with freshwater crayfish.\n\nAnd outstanding day, and a Jamaican food experience I\u2019ll never forget!\n\nFriends in the video:\nMatt Robinson: https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

We headed to the river, to cook up Jamaican curry goat, oxtail stew, and ackee and saltfish. Turned into an epic meal, great people, and an ultimate food experience in Jamaica.\n\nWe had the pleasure to hang out with Matt Robinson - The Jamaica Food Boss. He\u2019s such a cool guy, has a huge heart for Jamaican food, and he\u2019s so knowledgeable as well. He offers amazing food tours in Jamaica. Check them out when you\u2019re in Montego Bay: https://www.jafoodtours.com/\n\nSunday is family day in Jamaica and so we all headed out to the river for a Jamaican curry goat link-up! But to get there, we took a bamboo raft, something that\u2019s known in Jamaica, and extremely fun and relaxing. It was about a 15 minute bamboo raft ride to get to the site where Matt and the Chef\u2019s were setting up and ready to prepare this epic Jamaicna food feast.\n\n- Curry Goat - It would not be a party or a get together in Jamaica without curry goat, and it\u2019s one of Jamaica\u2019s best dishes.\n- Oxtail stew - We also made oxtail stew, a rich blend of oxtail including the meat, fat, and skin. The texture was insane.\n- Ackee and Saltfish - Additionally Chef made ackee and saltfish, the national food of Jamaica and easily my favorite dish of Jamaica as well. Loved it!\n- Peppa shrimp - And to begin this incredible meal, we started with some peppa shrimp - scotch bonnet pepper with freshwater crayfish.\n\nAnd outstanding day, and a Jamaican food experience I\u2019ll never forget!\n\nFriends in the video:\nMatt Robinson: https://www.instagram.com/jamaicafoodboss/\nJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

It also happens to be known for food - if you come to Iran and love food, you don\u2019t want to miss Rasht. In this Iranian food tour, we\u2019ll explore the unique dishes of Rasht, a family cooked local meal, and a vibrant market. #Iran #IranianFood #streetfood\n\nLocal Gilan Food Meal - We drove from Tehran straight to our first restaurant, located just outside the city of Rasht. It was a treat to have a local family prepare for us some of the Gilan food specialities. They made a wild bird, along with duck, and a number of different stews, and a number of different fried fish from the Caspian Sea. The use of walnut oil and sour pomegranate paste to flavor dishes, was entirely unique for me, and truly outstanding.\n\nMarket at Rasht - Next we headed over to the vibrant market of Rasht where we sampled a number of Iraninan street food dishes including a very unique rice pancake filled with walnuts, and a surprise skewer of lamb intestines roasted with blow torch.\n\nIranian Kebabs - Kebabs are probably the most well known Iranian food in all of Iran, and Rasht is known for their local style - especially sour kebabs - marinated in sour pomegranate paste. All the kebabs were delicious, but probably my favorite was the ultra rich and oily minced meat kebab that was then dunked into the melted lamb fat oil pan to soak up all the flavor. That\u2019s what you want to be eating at 3 am in the morning.\n\nIt was an amazing day in Rasht, Iran, and now I know exactly why they call Rasht an Iranian food capital of Iran!\n\nThank you also to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.\n\nFriends in the video:\nMr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/\nPersia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/\nRambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/\nAli: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83c\udf4cBanana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n\ud83d\udc55Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udcf1FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

It also happens to be known for food - if you come to Iran and love food, you don\u2019t want to miss Rasht. In this Iranian food tour, we\u2019ll explore the unique dishes of Rasht, a family cooked local meal, and a vibrant market. #Iran #IranianFood #streetfood\n\nLocal Gilan Food Meal - We drove from Tehran straight to our first restaurant, located just outside the city of Rasht. It was a treat to have a local family prepare for us some of the Gilan food specialities. They made a wild bird, along with duck, and a number of different stews, and a number of different fried fish from the Caspian Sea. The use of walnut oil and sour pomegranate paste to flavor dishes, was entirely unique for me, and truly outstanding.\n\nMarket at Rasht - Next we headed over to the vibrant market of Rasht where we sampled a number of Iraninan street food dishes including a very unique rice pancake filled with walnuts, and a surprise skewer of lamb intestines roasted with blow torch.\n\nIranian Kebabs - Kebabs are probably the most well known Iranian food in all of Iran, and Rasht is known for their local style - especially sour kebabs - marinated in sour pomegranate paste.
