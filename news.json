The Trinamool Congress workers accompanying her raised slogans, demanding the death penalty for the accused. The party demanded that the CBI should end the probe in the next 48 hours and arrest all accused.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which took over the probe of Kolkata's trainee doctor's rape and murder case, has arrived at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital as part of its investigation. Earlier today, the CBI team submitted a copy of its FIR before the Calcutta High Court.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kolkata Police have arrested 24 people for vandalism at the hospital during the nationwide 'Reclaim the Night' protest. According to the police, a group of 40 to 50 people, under the garb of demonstrations, broke into the hospital premises late on Wednesday night and vandalised property.\n#bengalgovernor #cvanandabose #kolkatarapemurder #kolkatadoctor #kolkatanews #rgkarhospital #rgkarhospitalnews #rgkarhospitalnewsupdate #doctorstrike #kolkatacbi #doctormurder #doctorrapeinkolkata #rapenews #murdernews #mamatabanerjee #westbengal #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                    "description": "Arshad Nadeem won gold in the men's javelin final in Paris Olympics, dethroning Neeraj Chopra. It was an epic India vs Pakistan duel at the Olympics and it promises to become bigger and bigger in the coming years.\n\nNeeraj Chopra was favourite to win gold medal in the men's javelin final in Paris. However, Arshad Nadeem stunned the field with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m. Neeraj came close to breaching the 90m-mark, but it was not enough.\n\nWhile India celebrated Neeraj Chopra's historic silver medal, there were bittersweet feelings too. Indian sports fans were not used to seeing Neeraj finish second-best often.\n\nNeeraj Chopra has promised to improve. He conceded that breaching 90m is a necessity.\n\nHowever, it was Arshad Nadeem's day as he stole the thunder at Stade de France in Paris. With limited support and facilities back home, Neeraj became Pakistan's first-ever track and field Olympic gold medalist.\n\nThe reactions in both countries was heartwarming. Neeraj Chopra's mother won hearts when she dismissed hate and said 'the guy who won gold is also our child'.\n\nAkshay Ramesh and Saurabh Kumar discuss the sensational men's javelin final at the Olympics.\n\nWatch!\n\nProduced by Anna Priyadarshini\n \n\nYou can also tune in here:\n \n \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6cmziLOjlHLlur13YqmtEf\n \n \nApple Podcasts:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fashion-scoop/id1728808543\n \n \nClick here for the latest podcast: https://podcasts.indiatoday.in/\n \n \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaTodayPodcasts\n \n \nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/IndiaTodayPods\n                        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/indiatodaypodcasts/\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                    "description": "Shivani Raja, an Indian-origin MP, has made headlines by taking her oath on the Bhagavad Gita in the UK Parliament. This significant event marks a new chapter in the representation of the Indian community in British politics. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East is especially noteworthy as it ends the Labour Party's 37-year dominance in the constituency. Her triumph, defeating Rajesh Agrawal with 14,526 votes, is a testament to her strong campaign and the support she garnered from the community. The Labour Party won the UK general election with 412 seats overall, but Shivani's individual victory stands out due to its historical and cultural implications.\n\n#ShivaniRaja #UKParliament #HistoricVictory #bhagvadgita #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                        "description": "Shivani Raja, an Indian-origin MP, has made headlines by taking her oath on the Bhagavad Gita in the UK Parliament. This significant event marks a new chapter in the representation of the Indian community in British politics. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East is especially noteworthy as it ends the Labour Party's 37-year dominance in the constituency. Her triumph, defeating Rajesh Agrawal with 14,526 votes, is a testament to her strong campaign and the support she garnered from the community. The Labour Party won the UK general election with 412 seats overall, but Shivani's individual victory stands out due to its historical and cultural implications.\n\n#ShivaniRaja #UKParliament #HistoricVictory #bhagvadgita #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

Speaking at a programme, she said, \"Such a big accident happened as people were trying to get Baba's feet. People should not have fallen into such superstition. I consider spreading such as a crime. Action must be taken against such people\". A stampede at a religious congregation in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh on July 2 killed 121 people, most of them women, as devotees suffocated to death and bodies piled atop each other.\n\n#HathrasStampede #UPGovernor #AnandibenPatel #BlindFaith #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

Earlier this week, a giant hoarding collapsed in city's Ghatkopar area during a massive dust storm, killing at least 16 people and injuring 74 others.\n\nIndia Today took stock of the situation and found all the pillars of the giant hoarding uprooted from the foundation. Its foundation pillars were not even 4 to 5 foot deep. Experts and officials believe that this incident was bound to happen due to its weak foundation.\n\n#mumbaihoardingcollapse #hoardingcollapse #ghatkoparhoardingcollapse  #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

Earlier this week, a giant hoarding collapsed in city's Ghatkopar area during a massive dust storm, killing at least 16 people and injuring 74 others.\n\nIndia Today took stock of the situation and found all the pillars of the giant hoarding uprooted from the foundation. Its foundation pillars were not even 4 to 5 foot deep. Experts and officials believe that this incident was bound to happen due to its weak foundation.\n\n#mumbaihoardingcollapse #hoardingcollapse #ghatkoparhoardingcollapse  #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

The former Karnataka Chief Minister also questioned why his and his father, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's names, were brought up since the case was \"not a family issue\".\n\nExplicit videos purportedly showing Prajwal Revanna went viral on social media just two days before the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka on April 26. The JD(S) MP is seeking a second term from the Hassan Lok Sabha seat.\n\n#indiatoday #jds #prajvalrevanna #sexualabuse #domestichelpabuse #karnatakagovernment #nsitprobe #fir\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                    "description": "Iran launched around 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. The attack lasted for five hours and 99 per cent of drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel. The Israeli military said that it was on high alert and monitoring all targets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the Israeli war cabinet at military headquarters in Tel Aviv after Iran's attack. Meanwhile, the US said it stood by Israel and will \"support their defence\". In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the US must stay away from the conflict between Iran and Israel and warned that Tehran's response would be more severe if Israel retaliates.

                        "description": "Iran launched around 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. The attack lasted for five hours and 99 per cent of drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel. The Israeli military said that it was on high alert and monitoring all targets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the Israeli war cabinet at military headquarters in Tel Aviv after Iran's attack. Meanwhile, the US said it stood by Israel and will \"support their defence\". In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the US must stay away from the conflict between Iran and Israel and warned that Tehran's response would be more severe if Israel retaliates.

                    "description": "Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all three charges in his federal gun trial, becoming the first son of a sitting US president to be receive a criminal conviction.\n\nProsecutors said Biden, 54, had lied about his drug use  on a federal form when he bought a handgun in 2018.\n\nBiden pleaded not guilty, claiming he was in recovery from drug addiction at the time and therefore did not lie on the gun application form.\n\nA panel of 12 Delaware jurors reached their verdict after about three hours of deliberations. Biden showed little emotion as he learned his fate. He stared ahead with arms folded before turning around to hug some of the associates on his legal team.\n\nHe faced two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                        "description": "Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all three charges in his federal gun trial, becoming the first son of a sitting US president to be receive a criminal conviction.\n\nProsecutors said Biden, 54, had lied about his drug use  on a federal form when he bought a handgun in 2018.\n\nBiden pleaded not guilty, claiming he was in recovery from drug addiction at the time and therefore did not lie on the gun application form.\n\nA panel of 12 Delaware jurors reached their verdict after about three hours of deliberations. Biden showed little emotion as he learned his fate. He stared ahead with arms folded before turning around to hug some of the associates on his legal team.\n\nHe faced two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

                    "description": "Boris Johnson has apologised, at the UK\u2019s official inquiry into the Covid pandemic, for the way his government handled the crisis.   The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

The IDF said it was looking into the reports of a fatality.

Refugees and migrants filming on mobile phones reveal how vulnerable people have to share taps and toilets with those who have tested positive for the virus, risking onward transmission. Strict quarantine is enforced on camps where coronavirus cases are confirmed, leading to some shortages in food, water and medical care inside. Fear of the virus and anger at camp conditions have led to violence. Panorama hears from charity and public health experts who warn that any failure to control the spread of the virus inside the camps could lead to potentially dangerous outbreaks.",

                        "description": "Panorama investigates conditions inside Greek migrant camps, locked down as coronavirus spread across the world. Refugees and migrants filming on mobile phones reveal how vulnerable people have to share taps and toilets with those who have tested positive for the virus, risking onward transmission. Strict quarantine is enforced on camps where coronavirus cases are confirmed, leading to some shortages in food, water and medical care inside. Fear of the virus and anger at camp conditions have led to violence. Panorama hears from charity and public health experts who warn that any failure to control the spread of the virus inside the camps could lead to potentially dangerous outbreaks."

The team of 24 researchers from India, Sweden, the US and the UK said that more than 140 mm of rainfall fell in a single day on soils highly saturated by two months of monsoon precipitation, triggering catastrophic landslides and floods that killed at least 231 people in Wayanad.\n\n#Wayanad #WayanadLandslide #WayanadNews #WayanadLandslidesNews #WayanadLandslidesDeaths #NDTVDigitalOriginals\nAbout NDTV (English news channel): \n \nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

The award was announced in 2019.From Moscow, PM Modi travelled to Austria, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country in 41 years.During his visit, PM Modi met Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Karl Nehammer and discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation in several sectors, including the environment and combating climate change.\n\nHe also discussed the ongoing disputes in the world, including the Ukraine conflict and the situation in West Asia, with the two leaders. \"My visit to Austria has been historic and immensely productive. New vigour has been added to the friendship between our nations. I am glad to have attended diverse programmes while in Vienna. Gratitude to Chancellor @karlnehammer, the Austrian Government and people for their hospitality and affection,\" the prime minister said in a post on X.

The award was announced in 2019.From Moscow, PM Modi travelled to Austria, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country in 41 years.During his visit, PM Modi met Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Karl Nehammer and discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation in several sectors, including the environment and combating climate change.\n\nHe also discussed the ongoing disputes in the world, including the Ukraine conflict and the situation in West Asia, with the two leaders. \"My visit to Austria has been historic and immensely productive. New vigour has been added to the friendship between our nations. I am glad to have attended diverse programmes while in Vienna. Gratitude to Chancellor @karlnehammer, the Austrian Government and people for their hospitality and affection,\" the prime minister said in a post on X.

The more we insist on a kind of cynical calculation in the place of a trusted relationship, the less we will get. As I also remind my Indian friends, while it is wider and it is deeper than it's ever been, it is not yet deep enough that if we take it for granted from the Indian side towards America, I'll fight a lot of defence battles trying to help this relationship ahead.\"\n\n#NDTVWorld #WorldNews #PMModi #Russia #PMModi #Austria #JoeBiden #USPolls #Palestine #Ukraine\n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel): \n \nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

Addressing an event, he said, \"It's important for us as Americans and as Indians to remember the more we put into this relationship, the more we will get out. The more we insist on a kind of cynical calculation in the place of a trusted relationship, the less we will get. As I also remind my Indian friends, while it is wider and it is deeper than it's ever been, it is not yet deep enough that if we take it for granted from the Indian side towards America, I'll fight a lot of defence battles trying to help this relationship ahead.\"\n\n#NDTVWorld #WorldNews #PMModi #Russia #PMModi #Austria #JoeBiden #USPolls #Palestine #Ukraine\n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel): \n \nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

Preliminary findings point to a combination of human error and signal failure as contributing factors.\n\nThe Railway Board's initial report on Monday revealed that the goods train, operating under a defective automatic signalling system, was travelling above speed limits when it crashed into the Kanchanjunga Express. The railways have not commented on this issue.\n\nWhen the automated system fails, railway protocol mandates a written authority known as TA 912. This document authorises train drivers to pass all red signals due to the signalling defect, provided they adhere to stringent safety measures.

That\u2019s what life is like for residents of the Norwegian town of Rjukan, set so low in a valley that they see no direct sunshine at all from October to March. Marnie Chesterton heads there to hear about an ingenious solution: giant mirrors that beam rays down into the town square, where locals gather to feel the reflected heat. \n\nThe man behind the project was motivated by a need for winter sun, but how much difference does it really make to our health and happiness? That\u2019s the question posed by this week\u2019s CrowdScience listener Michael, who has noticed living in the rainy Australian city of Melbourne is taking its toll. \n\nMany pensioners claim sunshine relieves aches and pains, as well as conditions like arthritis, but one of the biggest scientific studies found temperature actually has no impact on reported pain levels, while factors like air pressure and humidity may play a role. \n\nWhen it comes to our mood, it seems that spending time outside is more important than feeling the heat, and the optimum temperature for wellbeing is around cool 19 degrees centigrade, while excessive warm weather has been linked to an increase in violence and crime.\n\nCheck out more episodes of CrowdScience here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4cT4qluPKNtMmBAPPrpoxvT\n\nContributors:\nDr Anna Beukenhorst, University of Manchester\nProfessor Oscar Ybarra, University of Illinois\nProfessor Solomon Hsiang, University of California, Berkeley\nMartin Andersen, artist\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldser...\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#CrowdScience #Weather #Health #Wellbeing #Sunshine",

That\u2019s what life is like for residents of the Norwegian town of Rjukan, set so low in a valley that they see no direct sunshine at all from October to March. Marnie Chesterton heads there to hear about an ingenious solution: giant mirrors that beam rays down into the town square, where locals gather to feel the reflected heat. \n\nThe man behind the project was motivated by a need for winter sun, but how much difference does it really make to our health and happiness? That\u2019s the question posed by this week\u2019s CrowdScience listener Michael, who has noticed living in the rainy Australian city of Melbourne is taking its toll. \n\nMany pensioners claim sunshine relieves aches and pains, as well as conditions like arthritis, but one of the biggest scientific studies found temperature actually has no impact on reported pain levels, while factors like air pressure and humidity may play a role. \n\nWhen it comes to our mood, it seems that spending time outside is more important than feeling the heat, and the optimum temperature for wellbeing is around cool 19 degrees centigrade, while excessive warm weather has been linked to an increase in violence and crime.\n\nCheck out more episodes of CrowdScience here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4cT4qluPKNtMmBAPPrpoxvT\n\nContributors:\nDr Anna Beukenhorst, University of Manchester\nProfessor Oscar Ybarra, University of Illinois\nProfessor Solomon Hsiang, University of California, Berkeley\nMartin Andersen, artist\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldser...\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#CrowdScience #Weather #Health #Wellbeing #Sunshine"

But what CrowdScience listener Moses in Kenya wants to know is, why they bother making such long and precarious voyages - and how they're able to reliably navigate over hundreds and sometimes even thousands of miles. In this first of two episodes, presenter Anand Jagatia travels to the Americas to meet the scientists finding and tracking these animals in order to solve the puzzle of where they go and why.\n\nDeep in the lush and noisy Belizean jungle, Anand joins avian biologist Abidas who is collecting data on the beautiful birds that visit tropical forests to escape harsh winters. Here, using misting nets, Abidas and her team carefully catch birds to measure their health and status before tagging and releasing them so they can continue stocking up on jungle food. Anand finds out why having long term data on migrant birds can help in understanding why some birds, like the wood thrush, have been declining in their native homes further north.\n\nAnand then jumps aboard a turtle boat in Florida where scientists from the Sea Turtle Conservancy have been collecting data on these dinosaur-like creatures. But finding them is harder it might seem. They move fast, so Anand accompanies the research team who are experienced in safely catching them, will he be lucky and find one of these magnificent creatures?\n\nPresented by Anand Jagatia and produced by Melanie Brown\n\nContributors:\nDavid Barrie \u2013 Navigator & author\nTim Guilford \u2013 University of Oxford\nAbidas Ash \u2013 University of Belize\nKristen Ruegg \u2013 Colorado State University\nDavid Godfrey \u2013 Sea Turtle Conservancy\n\nListen/Download: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct1pry\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService\n\n#CrowdScience #Science #Migration #Animals #Birds",

                    "description": "Over the summer, a mysterious Twitter persona published details of over 14,500 social media accounts - all of them controlled by real-life Serbian citizens, it's claimed. They stand accused of posting\u2026 whatever the president\u2019s party tells them to.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our channel \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://bbc.in/3VyyriM\n\nIt\u2019s long been rumoured that Serbia\u2019s ruling SNS party commands the online activity of a small army of citizens, dubbed \u2018bots\u2019 by the opposition. But this kind of list, naming and shaming thousands of ordinary Serbians, is unprecedented.\n\nIf true, their activity represents a form of political corruption according to Serbia\u2019s public prosecutor. The government\u2019s response has alarmed observers - it shrugged off the story, publishing instead a veiled tongue-in-cheek \u2018admission\u2019.\n\nBut who is behind the list, and can it be trusted? BBC Trending has analysed the data in an attempt to establish if the \u2018bots\u2019 are indeed real people. And whether their accounts show evidence of co-ordinated activity.\n\nFeaturing interviews gathered on the ground in Belgrade, we hear from opposition politicians, pro-democracy activists and a self-professed real-life \u2018bot\u2019. She tells us she trolled the president\u2019s opponents under threat of losing her job \u2013 as a receptionist at a state-controlled electricity company in a small Serbian town.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n02:21 The SNS party and Aleksander Vucic\n03:34 Jovana\u2019s story as an online \u2018bot\u2019\n06:13 \u2018Bot\u2019 list made public\n08:48 CRTA \u2013 measuring and reporting about the quality of democracy in Serbia\n11:15 BBC Serbian bureau data journalist, Lazar Covs\n13:25 What do the social media platforms say?\n13:57 Jovana speaks up\n16:38 What does this tell us about Serbia\u2019s political landscape?\n\nReporter: Sam Judah\nEditor: Flora Carmichael\nAdditional reporting by: Grujica Andric, Lazar Covs, and Alison Benjamin.\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #serbia #bots",

                        "description": "Over the summer, a mysterious Twitter persona published details of over 14,500 social media accounts - all of them controlled by real-life Serbian citizens, it's claimed. They stand accused of posting\u2026 whatever the president\u2019s party tells them to.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our channel \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://bbc.in/3VyyriM\n\nIt\u2019s long been rumoured that Serbia\u2019s ruling SNS party commands the online activity of a small army of citizens, dubbed \u2018bots\u2019 by the opposition. But this kind of list, naming and shaming thousands of ordinary Serbians, is unprecedented.\n\nIf true, their activity represents a form of political corruption according to Serbia\u2019s public prosecutor. The government\u2019s response has alarmed observers - it shrugged off the story, publishing instead a veiled tongue-in-cheek \u2018admission\u2019.\n\nBut who is behind the list, and can it be trusted? BBC Trending has analysed the data in an attempt to establish if the \u2018bots\u2019 are indeed real people. And whether their accounts show evidence of co-ordinated activity.\n\nFeaturing interviews gathered on the ground in Belgrade, we hear from opposition politicians, pro-democracy activists and a self-professed real-life \u2018bot\u2019. She tells us she trolled the president\u2019s opponents under threat of losing her job \u2013 as a receptionist at a state-controlled electricity company in a small Serbian town.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n02:21 The SNS party and Aleksander Vucic\n03:34 Jovana\u2019s story as an online \u2018bot\u2019\n06:13 \u2018Bot\u2019 list made public\n08:48 CRTA \u2013 measuring and reporting about the quality of democracy in Serbia\n11:15 BBC Serbian bureau data journalist, Lazar Covs\n13:25 What do the social media platforms say?\n13:57 Jovana speaks up\n16:38 What does this tell us about Serbia\u2019s political landscape?\n\nReporter: Sam Judah\nEditor: Flora Carmichael\nAdditional reporting by: Grujica Andric, Lazar Covs, and Alison Benjamin.\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #serbia #bots"

More than a million people on Instagram followed her extraordinary career trajectory from extreme poverty in Brazil, to a European modelling career and a life of luxury in the US.   \n \nBut behind the perfectly curated posts is a story of witchcraft, exploitation and human trafficking - a dark and secretive sorority that led to missing women and sent their families and the FBI on a desperate search to find them.\n \nAfter months of investigations, a team from #BBCEye and https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil uncover a wellness empire built on half-truths and lies. This film tells the story of her enslaved followers and the heavy price they paid. And for the first time - in a surreal confrontation behind the walls of a Brazilian prison - we hear from the self-proclaimed \u201cguru\u201d who exerted absolute control.\n\n\ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f To watch more investigative journalism from our award-winning BBC Eye team check out this documentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4fADt3h_U2SOWErIq-xtXPD\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Watch this film in Portuguese on the https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bOqqQHhuQ\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to The Documentary Podcast \"Instagram's fake guru\" here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jc57vh\n\n00:00 Who is Kat Torres?\n02:59 Kat\u2019s modelling career\n04:53 Leonardo DiCaprio rumours\n06:48 Kat\u2019s Instagram career takes off\n10:23 Kat\u2019s inspirations\n13:50 Glamorous New York life\n15:22 Alleged oligarch boyfriend\n16:51 Ayahuasca ceremony\n18:00 The 'spiritual voice'\n22:17 Gathering followers in Texas\n25:10 Witchcraft practices\n30:12 The 'spiritual bath'\n35:32 Disturbing social media posts\n36:40 Girls go missing\n40:15 Secret recording of police call\n43:34 Exclusive interview with Kat in prison\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #Instagram #KatTorres #Brasil #Brazil #Luxury #Wellness",

More than a million people on Instagram followed her extraordinary career trajectory from extreme poverty in Brazil, to a European modelling career and a life of luxury in the US.   \n \nBut behind the perfectly curated posts is a story of witchcraft, exploitation and human trafficking - a dark and secretive sorority that led to missing women and sent their families and the FBI on a desperate search to find them.\n \nAfter months of investigations, a team from #BBCEye and https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil uncover a wellness empire built on half-truths and lies. This film tells the story of her enslaved followers and the heavy price they paid. And for the first time - in a surreal confrontation behind the walls of a Brazilian prison - we hear from the self-proclaimed \u201cguru\u201d who exerted absolute control.\n\n\ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f To watch more investigative journalism from our award-winning BBC Eye team check out this documentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4fADt3h_U2SOWErIq-xtXPD\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Watch this film in Portuguese on the https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bOqqQHhuQ\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to The Documentary Podcast \"Instagram's fake guru\" here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jc57vh\n\n00:00 Who is Kat Torres?\n02:59 Kat\u2019s modelling career\n04:53 Leonardo DiCaprio rumours\n06:48 Kat\u2019s Instagram career takes off\n10:23 Kat\u2019s inspirations\n13:50 Glamorous New York life\n15:22 Alleged oligarch boyfriend\n16:51 Ayahuasca ceremony\n18:00 The 'spiritual voice'\n22:17 Gathering followers in Texas\n25:10 Witchcraft practices\n30:12 The 'spiritual bath'\n35:32 Disturbing social media posts\n36:40 Girls go missing\n40:15 Secret recording of police call\n43:34 Exclusive interview with Kat in prison\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #Instagram #KatTorres #Brasil #Brazil #Luxury #Wellness"

Handed over to the Americans, Mullah Zaeef spent three years as a prisoner in the US detention centre, Guantanamo Bay. He no longer holds an official post in the Taliban, but he despises the democracy that has been built in Afghanistan over the last 20 years. He tells Lyse Doucet that Afghanistan needs a proper Islamic government.\n\nSeries music composed by Arson Fahim.\n\nHear more of the podcast: https://bbc.in/3h9jqRt\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService"

The day, which marks the assassination of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975, saw tensions flare as students wielding sticks and flags clashed with individuals they believed were Hasina supporters.

Following an electoral triumph for the BJP, securing 163 seats after battling two decades of incumbency, the stage is set for a grand celebration.

                    "description": "Parliament Session: The Rajya Sabha achieved a historic milestone on Thursday as it passed the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Bill, 2023, which mandates the reservation of one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies. Following extensive debates and discussions among Members of Parliament from various political parties, the Bill secured resounding support, with a total of 215 votes in favor and none against it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his concluding remarks on the Bill, expressed optimism about its potential to instill newfound confidence in the nation's citizens and underscored the positive collaborative efforts of all political parties in advancing women's empowerment.
